## Getting Things Done (GTD) {#getting-things-done--gtd}


## Zeigarnik Effect {#zeigarnik-effect}

Interrupted tasks are better remembered than completed ones

-   Stop coding halfway while having a good streak, and come back another day


## Work Clean (Mise-en-place) {#work-clean--mise-en-place}


### Preparation {#preparation}

1.  Always turn up early, greet the day
2.  Calculate Meeze point
    -   Optimal number of Actions done per day


### Process {#process}

1.  Optimize the workplace:
    -   Put pens etc near dominant hand, not so important things within
        arms reach. This is to prevent hands from crossing over, reducing friction.
    -   Think about all the pain points, and think about how to automate
        them.
    -   Make checklists for recurring tasks. Checklists are immutable,
        unlike task lists.
2.  Difference between immersive time and process time
    -   The first minutes matter more than the last
    -   process time sometimes has more value
    -   Assign a block of 30min in the morning for process time, then
        alternate between immersive and process time
3.  Clean as you go
    -   Remove distractions from workplace
    -   Close emails etc as you go
    -   Email mark and sweep process:
        1.  Look through once, flagging and marking all as read
        2.  Revisit flagged ones, take action if any
        3.  Unflag when done
4.  Slow down to move faster
    -   Deliberately slow down to access quality velocity
    -   Maintain some forward momentum
5.  Aim to finish/keep the finish in mind
    -   Do effort estimates, and try to keep tasks small, so that they're
        completable in shorter bursts
    -   Clock in time, take deliberate breaks in between, weigh the value
        of a pause in between work

### Capturing {#capturing}

Capture anything that comes to mind, and process them later on.


### Processing {#processing}

After collecting snippets, process them in what is called **layers**:

1.  **opening** the notes app to add images, text, links or other information
2.  **boldfacing** the key sentences in a note
3.  **highlighting** the most important sentences that you boldfaced.
4.  **summarizing** the note in your own words - in a sentence, image or
    diagram
5.  **creating** a blog post, tweet storm, video, podcast, or other
    expressions from what's learnt

Not all snippets require all layers of processing.

-   Capture any information that resonates with you
-   Add other layers whenever the urge strikes
-   Move insights from images into text
-   Separate capturing from the following phases


### Organizing (PARA) {#organizing--para}

Organize for **actionability** rather than meaning.

1.  **Project-related notes** are the most actionable. These include
    tasks that are to be completed, and any information directly
    related to these tasks.
2.  Notes about **areas of responsibility** come next, e.g. school, work.
3.  **Resource notes** include selected passages or complete contents of
    articles and books on any topic that are of special interest.
4.  Archives get the least follow-up.
