## Definition {#definition}

S\$NEER is the exchange rate between the Singdollar and a basket of currencies of
the country's major trading partners.

## Why manage S\$NEER? {#why-manage-s-neer}

The Singapore economy is small and open, where gross export and import of goods
are more than 300% of GDP. Almost 40 cents of every dollar spent domestically go
into imports. This means exchange rate has a much higher influence on inflation
and price stability.

## What is done with S\$NEER? {#what-is-done-with-s-neer}

The Singdollar is allowed to appreciate and depreciate against this basket of
currencies, which it does not disclose, within a band. If the threshold is
crossed, the MAS will intervene.

## How is the S\$NEER adjusted? {#how-is-the-s-neer-adjusted}

1.  In 2008, the MAS flattened the slope of the S\$NEER to prevent appreciation of the Singdollar
2.  In 2009, they economic recession resulted in a sharp fall of inflation, and
    the band was moved downwards
3.  In Apr 2010, the band was shifted to a positive slope, and upwards, following
    the recovery of the Singapore economy
