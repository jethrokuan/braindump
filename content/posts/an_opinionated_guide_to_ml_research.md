The keys to success are **working on the right problems, making continual
progress on them, and achieving continual personal growth.** This essay is
comprised of three sections, each covering one of these topics.


## Choosing Problems {#choosing-problems}

Develop good taste for what problems to work on.

1.  Read a lot of papers, and **assess them critically**.
2.  Work in a research group with other people working on similar topics.
3.  Seek advice from experienced researchers on what to work on.
4.  Reflect on what research is useful;
    1.  When is theory useful?
    2.  What causes some ideas to get wide uptake?


### Idea-Driven vs Goal-Driven Research {#idea-driven-vs-goal-driven-research}

Idea driven
: follow some sector of literature, and improve on
    existing ideas.
    -   **Cons:** High risk of getting snooped, or duplicating work,
        requires deep understanding of subject


Goal-driven
: Have vision of new AI capabilities, and experiment
    with diferent methods across the literature. Develop your own
    methods to improve on them.
    -   **Pros:** much more motivating. goals also give differentiating
        perspective from rest of the community.

John Schulman recommends goal-driven research.


### Tips for Goal-Driven research {#tips-for-goal-driven-research}

1.  Don't take the goal too literally. **Restrict yourself to general
    solutions.**
2.  Aim high, and climb incrementally towards high goals
    1.  Keep a notebook, and record daily ideas and experiments
        ([Note-taking]({{<relref "note_taking.md#" >}})). John Schulman creates an entry for each day, and
        conducts a review to condense entries every 1 or 2 weeks.
3.  Know when to switch problems. Also, don't switch problems too
    often. Notice the dead-ends in half-finished projects, and if there
    aren't any, make a commitment towards following through in the
    future.
4.  Have a fixed time budget for trying out new ideas that diverge from
    the main line of work.


## Personal Development {#personal-development}

-   Read textbooks, theses and papers, reimplement algorithms from these
    sources. Especially textbooks, because they condense information in
    an ordered fashion, and using proper notation!
-   Theses are a good place to find a literature review of an active field.
