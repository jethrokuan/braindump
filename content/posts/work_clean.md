## Preparation {#preparation}

1.  Always turn up early, greet the day
2.  Calculate Meeze point
    - Optimal number of Actions done per day

## Process {#process}

1.  Optimize the workplace:
    - Put pens etc near dominant hand, not so important things within
      arms reach. This is to prevent hands from crossing over, reducing friction.
    - Think about all the pain points, and think about how to automate
      them.
    - Make checklists for recurring tasks. Checklists are immutable,
      unlike task lists.
2.  Difference between immersive time and process time
    - The first minutes matter more than the last
    - process time sometimes has more value
    - Assign a block of 30min in the morning for process time, then
      alternate between immersive and process time
3.  Clean as you go
    - Remove distractions from workplace
    - Close emails etc as you go
    - Email mark and sweep process:
      1.  Look through once, flagging and marking all as read
      2.  Revisit flagged ones, take action if any
      3.  Unflag when done
4.  Slow down to move faster
    - Deliberately slow down to access quality velocity
    - Maintain some forward momentum
5.  Aim to finish/keep the finish in mind
    - Do effort estimates, and try to keep tasks small, so that they're
      completable in shorter bursts
    - Clock in time, take deliberate breaks in between, weigh the value
      of a pause in between work
