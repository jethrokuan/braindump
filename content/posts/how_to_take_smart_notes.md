## Book Notes {#book-notes}

### You need something to capture ideas whenever and wherever they pop into your head. {#you-need-something-to-capture-ideas-whenever-and-wherever-they-pop-into-your-head-dot}

### Focus on writing: rephrasing ideas into your own words, attending lectures with a clear purpose, focus on relevant aspects {#focus-on-writing-rephrasing-ideas-into-your-own-words-attending-lectures-with-a-clear-purpose-focus-on-relevant-aspects}

### Standardize notes into the slipbox format, which can be understood without context {#standardize-notes-into-the-slipbox-format-which-can-be-understood-without-context}

### Focus on what is interesting, let ideas accumulate and emerge without force {#focus-on-what-is-interesting-let-ideas-accumulate-and-emerge-without-force}

### academic writing is not a linear process {#academic-writing-is-not-a-linear-process}

### Having frequent feedback loops helps learning {#having-frequent-feedback-loops-helps-learning}

### Permanent notes must be written for an audience without context {#permanent-notes-must-be-written-for-an-audience-without-context}

### Reviewing is insufficient for learning, one learns best from elaboration {#reviewing-is-insufficient-for-learning-one-learns-best-from-elaboration}

### The slip-box handles recall and information storage, while the brain is in charge of creative linking and understanding {#the-slip-box-handles-recall-and-information-storage-while-the-brain-is-in-charge-of-creative-linking-and-understanding}

### Read texts with questions in mind {#read-texts-with-questions-in-mind}

### Writing with an eye towards existing notes allow us to take into account more information {#writing-with-an-eye-towards-existing-notes-allow-us-to-take-into-account-more-information}

### Elaborate on ideas in different contexts {#elaborate-on-ideas-in-different-contexts}

### Forgetting is important -- so we can focus on what's currently important {#forgetting-is-important-so-we-can-focus-on-what-s-currently-important}

### References between notes are much more important! {#references-between-notes-are-much-more-important}

### Make keywords specific, with context e.g. capital allocation problem {#make-keywords-specific-with-context-e-dot-g-dot-capital-allocation-problem}

### Comparing new notes with old notes help us discover differences and insight {#comparing-new-notes-with-old-notes-help-us-discover-differences-and-insight}

### Permanent notes require thinking about what's relevant for long-term thinking and idea development {#permanent-notes-require-thinking-about-what-s-relevant-for-long-term-thinking-and-idea-development}

### Ask questions like "what's interesting?" and "why should I note this down?" {#ask-questions-like-what-s-interesting-and-why-should-i-note-this-down}

## Motivations {#motivations}

- There's a ton of books covering the art of writing, and very little
  on note-taking.
- These books don't cover the connections between note-taking and
  writing well.

> Notes aren't a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking
> process. -- [Richard Feynman]({{< relref "richard_feynman" >}})

The mind is extremely reliant of external scaffolding:

> Notes on paper, or on a computer screen ... do not make contemporary
> physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it
> possible -- Neil Levy (Neuroethics and the Extended Mind)

Hence, use the [Zettelkasten]({{< relref "zettelkasten" >}}) method. To get around this idea of
note-taking, it is important to understand that:

1.  Note sequences are meant for developing ideas, not storing them
2.  Links and indices are helpful, but not central features
3.  The workflow is streamlined to writing

In [Zettelkasten]({{< relref "zettelkasten" >}}), the most time-consuming portion is determining _the
order_ for the notes in which to write about.

## Concrete Changes {#concrete-changes}

1.  Instead of highlighting passages, manually create notes of the
    ideas you get as you read. These notes should be relevant to the
    contexts important to you, not just related to the book you read.

2.  Always reference the source. Cite, or indicate the page number.
3.  When copying notes over, try to make the ideas standalone.
4.  When filing notes, think instead about: _in which context will I
    want to stumble on it again?_ Use tags for this.
