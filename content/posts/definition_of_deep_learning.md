There are many conflicting definitions of [Deep Learning]({{< relref "deep_learning" >}}), here's some
definitions by various people:

[Yann LeCun]({{< relref "yann_lecun" >}})
: DL is constructing networks of parameterized
functional modules & training them from examples using
gradient-based optimization ([Source](https://www.facebook.com/722677142/posts/10156463919392143/)) - Definition is orthogonal to the learning paradigm: paradigm,
