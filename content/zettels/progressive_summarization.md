The idea of progressive summarization is to create notes such that
their purpose is comprehensible in the future.

Layer 1
: When you encounter something interesting, capture it

Layer 2
: Bold the most interesting parts

Layer 3
: Highlight the most interesting bolded sections

Layer 4
: Summarize the bolded portions and the note in your own words

Layer 5
: Turn your notes into something new: a tweet, a blog post, even a book

All of these steps are optional. I think of these as distillation,
extracting key points from each note.
