## Why study conversation? {#why-study-conversation}

-   Tt seems that everyone can conduct conversation
-   There are basic patterns and techniques
    -   People do not adopt a totally new or different system for
        communicating in any given situation
    -   Conversational skill is adopted to other forms of interactive talk


### Sociology {#sociology}

> "What I call social facts are the ways of acting, thinking, and
> feeling external to the individual, and endowed with a power of
> coercion, by reason of which they control him"
>
> -   Emile Durkheim

-    Garfinkel's 'breaching' experiment

    -   Spend from 15 minutes to an hour in their homes imagining that you
        are boarders and act out this assumption. You should conduct
        yourself in circumspect and polite fashion. Avoid getting personal,
        to use formal address, to speak only when spoken to.
    -   Clarify everything which may not be immediately understandable for
        the non-family members

    We obey certain social rules, and make underlying social assumptions
    in all our interactions. This brings about social order.

-    What is a social situation?

    > I would define a social situation as an environment of mutual
    > monitoring possibilities... wherein an individual will find themselves
    > accessible to the naked senses of all others who present -- and
    > similarly, find those others accessible to him.
    >
    > -   Erving Goffman


### Linguistics {#linguistics}

-   Traditional linguistics see the language as an internal cognitive
    representation of individuals.

    acting -- Boas, Sapir

    community -- Gumperz, Hymes
