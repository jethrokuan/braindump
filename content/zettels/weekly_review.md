## Get Clear <code>[0/3]</code> {#get-clear}

-   [ ] Collect Loose Papers and Materials: Pull out all miscellaneous
    pieces of paper, business cards, receipts, and so on that have crept
    into the crevices of your desk, clothing, and accessories. Put it
    all in your in-tray for processing.
-   [ ] Get “IN” to Zero: Review any meeting notes and miscellaneous
    scribbles on notepaper or in your mobile devices. Decide and list
    any action items, projects, waiting-fors, calendar events, and
    someday/maybes, as appropriate. File any reference notes and
    materials. Get the “in” areas of e-mails, texts, and voice mails to
    zero. Be ruthless with yourself, processing all notes and thoughts
    relative to interactions, projects, new initiatives, and input that
    have come your way since your last download, and purging those not
    needed.
    -   [ ] Papers
    -   [ ] Physical Notebook
    -   [ ] Physical Objects
    -   [ ] Text Messages
    -   [ ] Email Inbox

-   [ ] Empty Your Head: Put into writing or text (in appropriate
    categories) any new projects, action items, waiting-fors,
    someday/maybes, and so forth that you haven’t yet captured and
    clarified.


## Get Current <code>[0/7]</code> {#get-current}

-   [ ] Review Action Lists: Mark off completed actions. Review for
    reminders of further action steps to record. Many times I’ve been
    moving so fast I haven’t had a chance to mark off many completed
    items on my list, much less figure out what to do next. This is the
    time to do that.
-   [ ] Archive completed or inactive projects, briefly reviewing each
    note and moving it to other notebooks if it could be useful there.
-   [ ] Review [Previous Calendar Data](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/agenda): Review the past two to three
    weeks of calendar entries in detail for remaining or emergent action
    items, reference information, and so on, and transfer that data into
    the active system. Grab every “Oh! That reminds me . . . !” with its
    associated actions. You will likely notice meetings and events that
    you attended, which trigger thoughts of what to do next about the
    content. Be able to archive your past calendar with nothing left
    uncaptured.
-   [ ] Review Upcoming Calendar: Look at further calendar entries
    (long-and short-term). Capture actions about projects and
    preparations required for upcoming events. Your calendar is one of
    the best checklists to review regularly, to prevent last-minute
    stress and trigger creative front-end thinking.\* Upcoming travel,
    conferences, meetings, holidays, etc. should be assessed for
    projects to add to your “Projects” and “Next Actions” lists for any
    of those situations that are already on your radar but not yet on
    cruise control.
-   [ ] Review Waiting For List: Any needed follow-up? Need to send an
    e-mail to get a status on it? Need to add an item to someone’s
    Agenda list to update when you’ll talk with him or her? Record any
    next actions. Check off any already received.
-   [ ] Review Project (and Larger Outcome) Lists: Evaluate the status
    of projects, goals, and outcomes, one by one, ensuring that at least
    one current kick-start action for each is in your system. Browse
    through any active and relevant project plans, support materials,
    and any other work-in-progress material to trigger new actions,
    completions, waiting-fors, etc.
-   [ ] Review Stuck Projects: Stuck projects are project that have no
    next actions. For the definitions of what a project is and how to
    check if it stuck, customize the variable ‘org-stuck-projects’.
-   [ ] Review Any Relevant Checklists: Is there anything else that you
    haven’t done, that you need or want to do, given your various
    engagements, interests, and responsibilities?a


## Get Creative <code>[0/2]</code> {#get-creative}

-   [ ] Review Someday Maybe List: Check for any projects that may have
    become more interesting or valuable to activate, and transfer them
    to Projects. Delete any that have simply stayed around much longer
    than they should, as the world and your interest have changed enough
    to take them off even this informal radar. Add any emerging
    possibilities that you’ve just started thinking about.
-   [ ] Be Creative and Courageous: Are there any new, wonderful,
    harebrained, creative, thought-provoking, risk-taking ideas you can
    capture and add into your system, or “external brain”?
