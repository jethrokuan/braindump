## Finding {#finding}

The way the biological human neuron implements XOR is by a formerly
unknown type of local response to inputs, which is low below the
threshold, maximal at the threshold and decreases as the input
intensifies above the threshold.

## Why is this interesting? {#why-is-this-interesting}

-   XOR used to be impossible to compute without inhibitory mechanisms,
    but this is makes that possible.
-   Hence the human brain can use a single-layered network to compute
    the XOR function.
