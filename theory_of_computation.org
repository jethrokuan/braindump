* Introduction
Finite automata are a useful model for many kinds of important
software and hardware. Automatas are found in compilers, software for
designing digital circuits, and many more systems.

/Grammars/ provide useful models when designing software that processes
data with a recursive structure. The compiler's parser deals with
recursively nested features. Regular Expressions also denote the
structure of data, especially in text strings.

The study of automata addresses the following questions:

1. What can a computer do?
2. What can a computer do efficiently?

Automata theory also provides a tool for making formal proofs, of both
the inductive and deductive type.

** Formal Proofs
Here the more common proof requirements are here:

1. Proving set equivalence: we can approach this by rephrasing it into
   an iff statement.
   1. Prove that if ~x~ is in ~E~, then ~x~  is in ~F.~
   2. Prove that if ~x~ is in ~F~, then ~x~ is in ~E~.

** Inductive Proofs
Suppose we are given a statement $S(n)$ to prove. The inductive
approach involves:
1. The /basis/: where we show $S(i)$ for a particular $i$.
2. The /inductive step/: where we show if $S(k)$ (or $S(i), S(i+1),
   \hdots, S(k)$) then $S(k+1)$.

** Structural Inductions
We can sometimes prove statements by construction. This is often the
case with recursively defined structures, such as with trees and
expressions. This works because we the recursive definition is invoked
at each step, so we are guaranteed that at each step of the
construction, the construction $X_i$ is valid.

* Automata Theory

** Definitions
- alphabet :: An /alphabet/ is a finite, nonempty set of symbols. E.g.
              $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$ represents the binary alphabet
- string :: A /string/ is a finite sequence of symbols chosen from some
            alphabet. For example, $01101$ is a string from the binary
            alphabet. The empty string is represented by $\epsilon$, and
            sometimes $\Lambda$. The
            /length/ of a string is denoted as such: $|001| = 3$
- Powers :: $\Sigma^k$ represents strings of length $k$.
- Concatenation :: $xy$ denotes the concatenation of strings $x$ and
                   $y$.
- Problem :: a /problem/ is the question of deciding whether a given
             string is a member of some particular language.

* Finite Automata
An automata has:
- a set of states
- its "control" moves from state to state in response to external inputs

A finite automata is one where the automaton can only be in a single
state at once (it is deterministic). Non-determinism allows us to
program solutions to problems using a higher-level language.

Determinism refers to the fact that on each input there is one and
only one state to which the automaton can transition from its current
state. Deterministic Finite Automata is often abbrieviated with /DFA/.

** Deterministic Finite Automata
A /dfa/ consists of:

1. A finite set of /states/, often denoted $Q$.
2. A finite set of /input symbols/, often denoted $\Sigma$.
3. A /transition function/ that takes as arguments a state and an input
   symbol and returns a state, often denoted $\delta$. If $q$ is a state,
   and $a$ is an input symbol, then $\delta(q,a)$ is that state $p$ such
   that there is an arc labeled $a$ from $q$ to $p$.
4. A /start state/, one of the states in $Q$.
5. A set of /final/ or /accepting/ states $F$. The set $F$ is a subset of
   $Q$.

In proofs, we often talk about a DFA in "five-tuple" notation:

\begin{equation}
  A = \left(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F \right)
\end{equation}

*** Simpler Notations
The two preferred notation for describing automata are:
- transition diagrams :: a graph

- transition table :: a tubular listing of the $\delta$ function, which by
     implication tells us the states and the input alphabet.

** Language of a DFA
We can define the /language/ of a DFA $A = \left(Q, \Sigma, q_0, F\right).
This language is denoted $L(A)$, and is defined by:

\begin{equation}
L(A) = \{ w | \delta(q_0, w) \text{ is in } F\}
\end{equation}

The language of $A$ is the set of strings $w$ that take the start
state $q_0$ to one of the accepting states.
