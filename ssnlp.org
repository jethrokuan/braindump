* AliNLP: the Text Processing Engine that Powers Alibaba's Business Applications

- Linlin Li

AliNLP is a large-scale NLP technology platform for the entire Alibaba
ecosystem.

- Utilizes behaviour data instead of demanding human annotations of
  NLP algorithms
- Utilizing multiple correlated tasks for improving effectiveness of
  individual tasks of the complex Alibaba eco-system

NLP Data:
 - language dictionary
 - token & POS corpus
 - Entity Corpus
 - Treebank
 - Sentiment Corpus
 - News Category Corpus
 - Word Relation Graph
 - Knowledge Graph
 
NLP Foundations:
 - Lexical Analysis
 - Syntactical Analysis
 - Semantic Analysis
 - text Analysis
 - Deep Learning
   - Word2vec
   - Graph2vec

Challenges in Chinese word segmentation application
- Limited amount of human annotated training data
- Frequent appearance of out-of-vocabulary words

- Taobao has billions of user search logs available
  - auto semi-annotated data

Multi-task learning : Combine human annotated data and automatically
** Machine Reading Comprehension
   - Aim at answering a question about a given domain/paragraph
   - Using IR based selection method to choose the relevant document/paragraph
   - No Pre-knowledge or FAQ needed

Encode Layer (BiLSTM) -> Attention Layer -> Match Layer (Bilinear
Match) -> Output Layer (Pointer Network)

Used in AliMe, Timi, Lazada Chatbot

Structured Knowledge Graphs (freebase knowledge graph)

"Natural Representations": Open IE - isolates propositions as
predicate--argument tuple

QA-SRL: Question answering - semantic role labeling

Each QA pair represents one predicate-argument relation
QA roles: Gunman takes own life after killing thrtee in Wisconsin spa
shooting. Form QASemDep Graph.

co-referring nodes/edges collapsed. 
* Noah Smith: Synchretizing Structured and Learned Representations

- Broad-coverage semantic parsing: baselines
- Building SCAFFOLD from alternative tasks
- Putting a SPIGOT on the pipeline

** NL Semantics : Two Operationalizations

   1. dependencies: a graph, entities/concepts/events as nodes,
      relations as edges
      - Turboparser (Martins et al)
      - JAMR (Flanigan et. al)
   2. spans: segmentation into labeled parts

Both associate words with predicates and arguments

** Linguistic Structure Prediction
x -> differentiable -> y (conventional NN)
x -> differentiable -> $argmax_{y\in Y}S^Ty$ -> structured output
(input text) -> (part representations) -> dynamic programming/spanning
tree/inference method (trained with loss e.g. hinge loss)

Open SESAME

joint learning
Use low-rank, sparse tensors
Promoting sparsity : 
\begin{equation}
  \lambda \sum_{y_i, z_j \in C} \left|S\left( y_i, z_j \right) \right|
\end{equation}

gave 14x speedup

Structured Attention, Straight-through estimator (Hinton 2012)

SPIGOT (structured projection of intermediate gradients)

$\hat{Z}$, the convex hull of intermediate parses

Sentence as graph vs sentence as sequence

dependency tree vs dependency semantics

* Automatic Essay Scoring
- Regression, classification, preference ranking
  - Prompt Independent Features
    - length, syntax, style etc.
  - Argumentation Features
    - argument components
    - argument relations
- Neural Models
  - No need for feature engineering: word (vectors) as features
  - Hard to interpret results

Essay scoring engines provides no feedback to the student on how to
improve the essay.

-end-to-end models

** Base Model
[[https://allenai.github.io/bi-att-flow/][BiDAF]]
 - Idea #1: Combine Convolution and Self-Attention
 - Convolution: Captures local context
   - But Global interaction requires $O(\log_kN)$ layers, and
     interactions become weaker as it goes deeper

Position Encoding -> repeat(Separable Convolution) -> Self Attention
-> Feed Forward

Augmentation:
- NMT, en - de -en  to get new QA pair

Deep Embedding through transfer learning:
- https://thegradient.pub/nlp-imagenet/
- ELMo (words have different embeddings depending on context)
