* Preparing for the Fourth Industrial Revolution
The industrial revolutions:

1. Water/steam engine
2. Electricity
3. Electronics and Information Technology
4. 9 areas of technologies: 3D printing, quantum computing...???
** John Hopcroft
- Automate intellectual jobs, reducing the percentage of population
  required to produce the goods and services we need, to 25%
  - 3.5m truck drivers in the US
    - those jobs are going to disappear the same way elevator
      operators disappear
  - Employees in China checked it via face recognition
- We need to figure out how to engage the rest of the population in
  meaningful activities
- Universal guaranteed income?!
*** On Change
- Positive aspects and negative aspects to major change
- Typically, the positive aspects dominate the negative aspects
- 2012 ImageNet competition. Up until 2012, the best error rate was
  25%, but AlexNet brought this error rate down to 15%.
*** Is AI really artificial intelligence?
- No? The state-of-the-art is really pattern recognition in high
  dimensional space.
  - Computer can recognise a bicycle, but can't recognise its
    function.
*** How to choose the problems you work on?
- "you get one life to live, and you ought to enjoy the entire lifetime"
- "make a little investment for the future years"
- could switch jobs because he was working in a non-experimental area
*** Does the degree matter?
- "degree is a union card"
- optimal vs have-to-do
  - to get admission to top phd programs, some universities start
    counting publications
*** What does it mean for a computer to be more intelligent than a human being?
- what is a good definition of intelligence?
  - his old definition: "the ability to solve problems"
- computers only have the ability to solve a certain class of
  problems, given a large amount of computing power
*** Privacy as a trade-off
- Privacy is going to be a big issue in the 4th industrial revolution
- We will change a little bit about what we allow companies and
  corporations know about us
- We can play back wherever the car have driven
  - Use this data to improve route guidance systems
  - but they can figure out things like where you work, where you shop
  - Solutions:
    - 0-knowledge proof???
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof
    - e.g. prove that i can fill a sudoku puzzle without any
      information of how to do it
    - importance, e.g.;
      - insurance companies get a rigorous mathematical proof about
        how much money to pay the person
      - giving hospitals complete medical records, and not insurance
        companies becomes a possibility
*** Can computers formulate problems that humans want to work with?
- Supervised learning vs unsupervised learning
*** Concentration of power
- Companies have only existed for 200 years, society can change and
  nations evolved at soem point, it's not clear if even nations can continue.
  - Many companies are far more powerful than countries -- could they
    begin to take the role of nations today?
*** Working on a healthy way towards the 4th Industrial Revolution?
- A century ago, people work 70 hours a week, and start working at 10
- There's been a drastic reduction to a fraction of work power that's
  actually being used
- There are some countries looking at how to provide a guaranteed
  financial income to people, and engage people in meaningful activity
- Some people believe that only two countries will benefit from the AI
  revolution: China and United States (nani??)
  - China is worried about the poor, how do we restructure society?
*** Computers and morality
- I work on simpler problems...
- Self driving cars in the US cannot be programmed to go beyond the
  speed limit and violate the law
  - normal speed limit is 65 miles an hour, but most drive at 71-72
    miles per hour
*** Anything that scares you about the 4th Industrial Revolution?
- optimistic, on average it's going to be a better world to live in
*** What area of research would you want to work on?
- Why does deep learning work?
*** Advice
- pick an assistant professor
- career was built on the graduate students, APs are a better choice
  typically.

** Stuart Parkins
- Bella likes his voice (mellow and deep, resonant, calming) 🎤
- Our ability to compute has improved a thousandfold each decade
- Humans are very poor at looking at the future and predicting what happens
*** Drivers for 4th Industrial Revolution that are non-computing related
- draw conclusions using algorithms that were developed 10-20 years
  ago, because of huge computing power
- computers, built on silicon, don't think the way humans think
  - systems that can model the human brain
- *silicon increased in performance has slowed down considerably*
  - /is there an alternative to silicon in research right now?/
- *"lateral thinking"*
  - How do you pick the problems to work on?
*** How to choose the problems you work on?
- choose an interesting challenge, that is exciting and interesting
*** Does the degree matter?
- no you don't need a degree.
- it's crazy that scientific journals can keep knowledge proprietary
  when the research is largely funded by the government
*** Jethro - Why is this guy so controversial?
*** Computers vs Human Beings
- We're limited in the number of neurons and synapses we have
  - observable from biology
- Computers are already more intelligent than humans in that sense
*** Can computers formulate problems that humans want to work with?
- Material discovery, taking a certain mix of elements you can
  calculate their properties
- Compute the inverse: given certain properties, can you give me a
  material that works?
*** Concentration of Power
- IBM was the largest compute power in the world
  - only lasted a few decades, getting overwhelmed by pace of change
- Can already see signs of Google's mortality
*** Working on a healthy way towards the 4th Industrial Revolution?
- In silicon valley, people do work 70 hours a week
- Maybe it will be a world where people will want to work!
  - Automate the mundane jobs, leaving the jobs that require creativity
- How do you want to distribute wealth, in Europe, people are already
  are working a lot less than in the US and they are choosing
  different models of a wealth distribution, so it boils downw to a
  question of society and what people choose.
*** Computers and Morality
- Humans are programmed to preserve ourselves
- E.g. car is programmed to save your own life than other people's lives
*** Anything that scares you about the 4th Industrial Revolution?
- super optimistic
- systems would know how to auto-correct itself.
*** What area of research would you want to work on?
- How do human's think?
*** Regulation of AI
- How to regulate AI when not sure how it'll evolve?
*** Augmented Intelligence
