A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome

An agent is a function from percept histories to actions, i.e. \(f: P^*
\rightarrow A\). We seek the best-performing agent for a certain task;
must consider computation limits.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
Simple to implement, and works. However, the number of table entries
is exponential in time: \(\text{#percepts}^\text{time}\). Hence it is
doomed to failure. The key challenge to AI is to produce rational
behaviour from a small program rather than a vast table.

<h3 id="org1ba25a2"><span class="section-number-3">2.6</span> Reflex agents</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
<p>
A simple reflex agent is one that selects actions on the basis of the
<i>current</i> percept, ignoring the rest of the percept history. A
<i>condition-action</i> rule is triggered upon processing the current
percept. E.g. <b>if</b> the car in front is braking, <b>then</b> brake too.
</p>

<p>
Basing actions on only the current percept can be highly limiting, and
can also lead to infinite loops. Randomized actions of the right kind
can help escape these infinite loops.

<h3 id="org8b4443c"><span class="section-number-3">2.7</span> Model-based Reflex Agents</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-7">
<p>
The agent maintains some <b>internal state</b> that depends on percept
history and reflects at least some of the unobserved aspects of the
current state. Information about how the world evolves independently
from the agent is encoded into the agent. This knowledge is called a
<b>model</b> of the world, and this agent is hence a <b>model-based</b> agent.

<h3 id="orgb3328ee"><span class="section-number-3">2.8</span> Goal-based agents</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-8">
<p>
Knowing about the current state of the environment may not be enough
to decide on what to do. Agents may need <b>goal</b> information that
describes situations that are desirable. Sometimes goal-based action
selection is straightforward, but in others <b>searching</b> and <b>planning</b>
are required to achieve the goal. Goal-based agents are flexible
because the knowledge that supports its decisions is represented
explicitly and can be modified, although it is less efficient.

<h3 id="org7b2d55d"><span class="section-number-3">2.9</span> Utility-based agents</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-9">
<p>
Goals provide a binary distinction between good and bad states. A more
general performance measure should allow a comparison between world
states according to exactly how good it is to the agent. An agent's
<b>utility function</b> is an internalisation of the performance measure.
An agent chooses actions to maximise its expected utility. A
utility-based agents has to model and keep track of its environment.

A more expressive representation can capture, at least as concisely, a

<i>Greedy best-first search</i> tries to expand the node that is closest to
the goal, on the grounds that this is likely to lead to a solution
quickly. It evaluates nodes by using just the heuristic function:
\(f(n) = h(n)\).
</p>

<p>
Greedy best-first tree search is incomplete even in a finite state
space. The graph search version is complete in finite spaces, but not
in infinite ones. The worst case time and space complexity is
\(O(b^m)\). However, with a good heuristic function, the complexity can

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-4-2">
<p>
It evaluates nodes by combining \(g(n)\) the cost to reach the node, and
\(h(n)\) the cost to get to the goal: \(f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\). Since \(g(n)\)
gives the path cost from the start node to node \(n\), and \(h(n)\) is the
estimated cost of the cheapest path from \(n\) to the goal,$f(n) = $
estimated cost of the cheapest solution through \(n\).
</p>

<p>
\(h(n)\) is an <i>admissible heuristic</i> iff it never overestimates the
cost to reach the goal. For A*, this means that \(f(n)\) would never
overestimate the cost of a solution along the current path.
</p>

<p>
Admissible heuristics are by nature optimistic because they think the
cost of solving the problem is less than it actually is.
</p>

<p>
A second, slightly stronger condition is called <i>consistency</i>, and is
required only for applications of A* to graph search. A heuristic
\(h(n)\) is <i>consistent</i> iff for every node \(n\) and every successor \(n'\)
of \(n\) generated by any action \(a\), the estimated cost of reaching the
goal from \(n\) is no greater than the step cost of getting to \(n'\) plus
the estimated cost of reaching the goal from \(n'\): \(h(n) \le
c(n,a,n') + h(n')\). This is a form of the general triangle inequality.
</p>

<p>
A* search is complete, optimal and optimally efficient with a
consistent heuristic. The latter means that no other optimal algorithm
is guaranteed to expand fewer nodes than A*.
</p>

<p>
However, for most problems, the number of states within the goal
contour search space is still exponential in the length of the
solution. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>absolute error</i> of a heuristic is defined as \(\Delta = h^*-h\),
and the <i>relative error</i> is defined as \(\epsilon = \frac{h^*-h}{h*}\).
The complexity results depend strongly on the assumptions made about
the state space. For constant step costs, it is \(O(b^{\epsilon d})\),
and the effective branching factor is \(b^\epsilon\).
</p>

<p>
A* keeps all generated nodes in memory, and hence it usually runs out
of space  long before it runs of time. Hence, it is not practical for
large-scale problems.

One way to avoid continuous problems is simply to <i>discretize</i> the
neighbourhood of each state. Many methods attempt to use the
<i>gradient</i> of the landscape to find a maximum: \(x \leftarrow x +
\delta \nabla (x)\), where $&delta; is a small constant called the <i>step
size</i>. For many problems, the <i>Newton-Raphson</i> method is effective. It
solves the roots for equations \(g(x) = 0\), by computing a new
estimate: \(x \leftarrow x - g'(x)/g(x)\). To find a maximum or minimum
of \(f\), we need to find \(x\) such that the gradient is zero. In this
case \(g(\mathbf{x})\) in Newton's formula becomes \(\nabla
f(\mathbf{x})\) and the update equation can be written in matrix-vector
form as:
</p>

\begin{align*}
\mathbf{x} \leftarrow \mathbf{x} - H_f^{-1}(\mathbf{x})\nabla f(\mathbf{x})

where \(H_f\) is the <i>Hessian</i> matrix of second derivatives. For
high-dimensional problems, computing the \(n^2\) entries of the Hessian
and inverting it may be expensive, and approximate versions have been

When the environment is either partially observable or
non-deterministic, percepts become useful. In a partially observable
environment, every percept helps narrow down the set of possible
states the agent might be in. In a non-deterministic environment,
percepts tell the agent which of the possible outcomes of its actions
has actually occurred. Future percepts cannot be determined in
advance, and the agent's future actions will depend on those future
percepts. The solution to a problem is not a sequence but a
<i>contingency plan</i>

<p>
Problem-solving agents that deal with atomic representations of states
require good domain-specific heuristics to perform well. The hybrid
propositional logical agent can find plans without domain-specific
heuristics because it uses domain-independent heuristics based on the
logical structure of the problem. However, it relies on ground
propositional inference, and suffers when there are large numbers of
actions and states.
</p>

<p>
<b>Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)</b> was created in response to
these deficiencies.
</p>

<p>
Each state is represented as a conjunction of fluents that are ground,
functionless atoms. Database semantics is used, which involves:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>closed-world assumption</dt><dd>all fluents not mentioned are false</dd>
<dt>unique names assumption</dt><dd>fluents with different names are distinct</dd>

<p>
State representations are carefully designed so that they can be
manipulated by set operations or logical inference.

While the number of states is finite, adding function symbols make
them infinite, making these problems semi-decidable at best. Certain
restrictions can reduce the questions into a P class problem.

The first approach is forward (propogation) state-space search, which
searches forward from the initial state. However, it is inefficient,
for the following reasons:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It tends to explore irrelevant actions</li>
<li>Planning problems tend to have large state spaces, and relatively
small problems will be an issue without a good heuristic</li>
</ol>

<p>
It turn out that good domain-independent heuristics can be derived for
forward search, which makes it feasible.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, we can do a backward (regression) state-space search,
which looks for actions that can lead to the goal. Unlike forward
search, backward search only explores relevant actions, hence has a
low branching factor. However, backward search deals with sets, which
are make it harder to derive good domain-independent heuristics.

Framing the search problem as a graph where the nodes are states and
the edges are actions. We can think of a number of ways to relax the
problem, generating admissible heuristics:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Add more edges to the graph, making it easier to find a path</li>
</ol>

<p>
The <b>ignore preconditions heuristic</b> drops all preconditions from
actions, and every action becomes applicable in every state. We count
the number of actions required such that the union of the action's
effects satisfy the goal. This is called the set-cover problem, which
is unfortunately NP-hard. We can also ignore selected preconditions of
actions.
</p>

<p>
The ignore delete list heuristic, drops all negative literals in goals
and preconditions. This way, an action cannot undo progress towards
the goal, and each action taken would monotonically progress towards
it.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Grouping multiple nodes together, shrinking the size of the graph</li>

We can reduce the number of states by forming a <b>state abstraction</b> &#x2013; a
many-to-one mapping from states in the ground representation of the
problem to the abstract representation. For example, one can ignore
some fluents.
</p>

<p>
The key idea in defining heuristics is <b>decomposition</b>: diving a problem

<p>
Utility theory combines with probability theory to yield a
decision-making agent, that can make rational decisions based on what
it believes and what it wants. This is opposed to goal-based agents,
that make binary decisions between good and bad states.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-1">
<p>
Under nondeterministic, partially observable environments, the result
of an action cannot be represented by a single number. \(RESULT(\alpha)\) is
now expressed as a random variable, whose values are the possible
outcome states with corresponding probabilities of occurrence. The
probability of an outcome \(s'\), given evidence observations
\(\mathbb{e}\), is written \(P(RESULT(\alpha) = s' | a, \mathbb{e})\).
</p>

<p>
The agent's preferences are captured by a <b>utility function</b> \(U(s)\),
which expresses the desirability of a state. We can calculate the
expected utility of a function as follows:
</p>

\begin{equation}
  EU(a | \mathbb{e}) = \sum_{s'} P(RESULT(\alpha) = s' | a,  \mathbb{e}) U(s')
\end{equation}

<p>
The principle of maximum expected utility (MEU) says that a rational
agent should choose the action that maximizes the expected utility. If
an agent acts to maximise a utility function that correctly reflects
all possible outcomes, then it will achieve the highest possible
performance score (averaged across all environments).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-2">
<p>
To show why MEU is a rational choice, we turn to utility theory.
First, we define notation:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(A \succ B\): the agent prefers \(A\) over \(B\).</li>
<li>\(A \sim B\): the agent is indifferent between \(A\) and \(B\).</li>
<li>\(A \succeq B\): the agent prefers \(A\) over \(B\), or is indifferent.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The axioms of utility theory are:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>orderability</dt><dd>Exactly one of \(A \succ B\), \(B \succ A\) or \(A \sim B\) holds.</dd>
<dt>transitivity</dt><dd>\((A \succ B) \wedge (B \succ C) \Rightarrow A \succ C\)</dd>
<dt>continuity</dt><dd>\(A \succ B \succ C \Rightarrow \exist p [p, A; 1-p, C] \sim B\)</dd>
<dt>substitutability</dt><dd>\(A \sim B \Rightarrow [p, A; 1-p, C] \sim [p, B; 1-p, C]\)</dd>
<dt>monotonicity</dt><dd>\(A \succ B \Rightarrow (p > q) \iff [p, A; 1-p B] \succ [q, A; 1-q,

     (1-p)q, C]\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
von Neumann and Morgenstern showed that following these axioms, it can
be shown that.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Utility functions exist</b>. \(U(A) > U(B) \iff A \succ B\) and \((U(A) = U(B)

probability of each outcome, multiplied by the utility of that
outcome: \(U([p_1, S_1; \dots; p_n, S_n]) = \sum_i p_iU(S_i)\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Utility functions are not unique: in fact, that are not changed with
affine transformations, of the form \(U'(s) = aU(s) + b\). This is
because the agent only needs a preference on the ranking of states,
and the actual value of the utility does not matter.

<p>
To build a decision-theoretic system, we must first work out what the
agent's utility function is. This process is called <b>preference
elicitation</b>, which involves presenting choices to the agent and using
the observed preferences to pin down the underlying utility function.
</p>

<p>
We have established above that utility functions are not unique, but
it helps to have a <b>normalized utility</b>. Normalized utilities fix the
utility of a "best possible prize" at \(u_\top = 1\) and the "worst possible
prize" at \(u_\bot = 0\).
</p>

<p>
Given this utility scale, we can assess the utility of a prize \(S\), by
asking the agent to choose between \(S\) and the standard lottery \([p,
u_\top;1-p, u_\bot]\). \(p\) is adjusted until the agent is indifferent
between \(S\) and the lottery. This is done for each prize \(S\).

</p>

<p>
If \(A_1\) stochastically dominates \(A_2\), then for any monotonically

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-4-2">
<p>
Multi-attribute utility theory is based on the supposition that
preferences of typical agents have structure. This alleviates the
difficulty in expressing a utility function with many attributes and
possible distinct values.
</p>

<p>
One simple regularity in preference structures is called preference
independence. Two attributes \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) are preferentially
independent if the preference between outcomes \((x_1, x_2, x_3)\) and
\((x_1', x_2', x_3)\) does not depend on the value of the value \(x_3\) of
attribute \(X_3\).
</p>

<p>
If all attributes are mutually preferentially independent, then an
agent's preference can be described by maximising the function:
</p>

\begin{equation}
  V(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) = \sum_i V_i(x_i)
\end{equation}

<p>
An example is:
</p>

\begin{equation}
V(noise, cost, deaths) = - noise \times 10^4 - cost - deaths \times 10^{12}
\end{equation}

<p>
Under uncertainty, the mathematics gets a bit more complicated.
Utility independence extends preference independence to cover
lotteries: a set of attributes \(\mathbb{X}\) is utility independent of
a set of attributes \(\mathbb{Y}\) if preference between lotteries on
the attributes in \(\mathbb{X}\) are independent of the particular
values of the attributes in \(\mathbb{Y}\).
</p>

<p>
Mutual utility independence implies that the agent's behaviour can be
described using a multiplicative utility function. If we denote \(U_i\)
to be \(U_i(x_i)\), then a 3 attribute utility function can be expressed
as:
</p>

\begin{equation}
 U = k_1U_1 + k_2U_2 + k_3U_3 + k_1k_2U_1U_2 + k_1k_3U_1U_3 +

The value of a given piece of information is defined to be the
difference in expected value between the best action before and after
information is obtained.  This is one of the most important parts of
decision-making: knowing what information to obtain.  Information has
value to the extent that it is likely to cause a change of plan and to
the extent that the new plan is significantly better than the old
plan.
</p>

<p>
Mathematically, the value of perfect information (VPI) is defined as:
</p>

\begin{equation}
VPI_e(E_j) = \left( \sum_k P(E_j = e_{jk} | \mathbb{e})
  MEU(\alpha_{e_{jk}} | \mathbb{e}, E_j = e_{jk}) \right) - MEU(\alpha |

The theorem is about the expected value, and not the real value. This

It is important to note that VPI is dependent on the current state of

Earlier, we were concerned with environments with one-shot, episodic
decision problems. Sequential decision problems incorporate utilities,
uncertainty and sensing. These include searching and planning problems
as special cases.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-1">
<p>
A sequential decision problem for a fully observable, stochastic
environment with a Markovian transition model and additive rewards is
called a Markov decision process. It consists of a set of states, with
initial state \(s_0\), a set \(ACTIONS(s)\) of actions in each state, a
transition model \(P(s'|s, a)\), and a reward function \(R(s)\).
</p>

<p>
A policy, denoted \(\pi\), specifies what the agent should do in any state
\(s\). This action is denoted by \(\pi(s)\). The optimal policy $&pi;<sup>*</sup>$*yields the
highest expected utility.
</p>

<p>
The careful balancing of risk and reward is a characteristic of MDPs
that does not arise in deterministic search problems.

<h3 id="org8fd6858"><span class="section-number-3">10.2</span> Utilities over time</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-2">
<p>
A finite horizon for decision making means that there is a fixed time
\(N\) after which nothing matters. In these scenarios, the optimal
action in a given state could change over time, i.e. the optimal
policy is non-stationary.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that under stationarity, there are only 2 coherent ways
to assign utilities to sequences:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>additive rewards</dt><dd>\(U_h([s_0, s_1, \dots, s_n]) = R(s_0) + R(s_1) + \dots + R(s_n)\)</dd>
<dt>discounted rewards</dt><dd>\(U_h([s_0, s_1, \dots, s_n]) = R(s_0) + \gamma \cdot R(s_1) + \dots +
     \gamma^2 \cdot R(s_n)\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This discount factor \(\gamma\) is a number between 0 and 1. Assuming
stationarity has several problems. First, if the environment does not
contain a terminal state, then utilities of undiscounted rewards go to
infinite, and comparing two infinitely state sequences would be
impossible. With discounted rewards, the utility of an infinite
sequence can be made finite.
</p>

<p>
However, if the environment contains a terminal state, and the agent
is guaranteed to reach a terminal state eventually, then this policy
is called a <b>proper policy</b>, and the above issue goes away. Infinite
sequences can be compared in terms of the average reward obtained per
time step.

<h3 id="org9def1bb"><span class="section-number-3">10.3</span> Optimal policies and the utilities of states</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-3">
<p>
First, we can derive the expected utility of executing a policy \(\pi\) in
\(s\):
</p>

\begin{equation}
U^\pi (s) = E\left[ \sum_{t=0}^\inf \gamma^t R(S_t) \right]
\end{equation}

<p>
where the expectation is with respect to the probability distribution
over state sequences. determined by \(s\) and \(\pi\). Then $&pi;<sup>*</sup>(s) =
argmax<sub>&pi;</sub> U^&pi; (s)*.
</p>

<p>
A consequence of using discounted utilities with infinite horizons is
that the optimal policy is independent of the starting state. This
allows us to compute the true utility of the state as \(U^{\pi^*} (s)\).
The utility function allows the agent to select actions by using the
principle of maximum expected utility from the earlier chapter: \(\pi^*(s)
= argmax_{a \in A(s) } \sum_{s^'} P(s' |s, a)U(s')\).

<h3 id="org69aaa4e"><span class="section-number-3">10.4</span> Value Iteration</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-4">
<p>
The bellman equation illustrates that the utility of a state is the
immediate reward for that state plus the expected discounted utility
of the next state:
</p>

\begin{equation}
U(s) = R(s) + \gamma max_{a \in A(s)} \sum_{s'} P(s' | s, a)U(s')
\end{equation}

<p>
If there are \(n\) possible states, there are \(n\) Bellman equations to
solve. However, these equations are non-linear, and cannot be solved
using linear algebra techniques.
</p>

<p>
Value iteration is an algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to an
equilibrium. The basic idea is to start with arbitrary initial values
for the utilities. We compute the right hand side of the equation, and
update the utility on the left hand side of the equation.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-5">
<p>
We have already observed that it is possible to get an optimal policy,
without having accurate utility function estimates.
</p>

<p>
The policy iteration algorithm exploits this. The algorithm alternates
between 2 steps, beginning at some policy \(\pi_0\):
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Policy evaluation</b>: given a policy \(\pi_i\), calculate \(U_i = U^{\pi_i}\),
the utility of each state if \(\pi_i\) were to be executed</li>
<li><b>Policy improvement</b>: calculate a new MEU policy \(\pi_{i+1}\), using
one-step look ahead based on \(U_i\):</li>
</ol>

\begin{equation}
\pi^* (s) = argmax_{a \in A(s)} P(s' | s, a) U(s')
\end{equation}

<p>
Policy evaluation is simple, because the policy \(\pi_i\) specifies the
action \(\pi_i(s)\) in state \(s\). This means we have a simplified version
of the Bellman equation relating the utility of \(s\) to the utility of
its neighbours:
</p>

\begin{equation}
  U(s) = R(s) + \gamma  \sum_{s'} P(s' | s, a)U(s')
\end{equation}

<p>
These equations are linear and can be quickly solved (in \(O(n^3)\) time)
with linear algebra techniques. We can further speed up this process
by performing an approximate policy evaluation. We do this by
performing some number of value iteration steps to update the
utilities:
</p>

\begin{equation}
U_{i+1}(s) \leftarrow R(s) + \gamma \sum_{s'}P(s'|s, \pi_i(s))U_i(s')
\end{equation}

<p>
The resulting algorithm is called modified policy iteration, and is
often much more efficient.

<b>Asynchronous policy iteration</b> involves picking a subset of states and

guaranteed to converge, and the freedom to choose any subset of states

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-6">
<p>
The assumption of full observability, accompanied with the Markov
assumption for the transition model means that the optimal policy
depends only on the current state. When the environment is partially
observable, the agent does not know which state it is in. The agent
then cannot execute \(\pi(s)\). The utility of a state \(s\) and the optimal
action in \(s\) does not only depend on \(s\), but also how much the agent
knows when it is in \(s\).
</p>

<p>
In addition to the elements of the MDP &#x2013; the transition model
\(P(s'|s, a)\), actions \(A(s)\), and reward function \(R(s)\), it also has
a sensor model \(P(e|s)\). The sensor model specifies the probability of
perceiving evidence \(e\) in state \(s\). For example, a sensor might
measure the number of adjacent walls. A noisy sensor might return the
wrong value with some probability.
</p>

<p>
Belief states are the set of actual states the agent might be in. In
POMDPs, these belief states are probability distributions over all
possible states. The agent can calculate its current belief state as
the conditional probability distribution over the actual states given
the sequences of percepts and actions so far.
</p>

<p>
If the previous belief state is \(b(s)\), and the agent performs some
action \(a\) and perceives evidence \(e\), then the new belief state is
given by:
</p>

\begin{equation}
b'(s') = \alpha P(e | s') \sum_s P(s' | s, a) b(s)
\end{equation}

<p>
where \(\alpha\) is a normalizing constant that makes the belief state sum
to 1.
</p>

<p>
<b>The optimal action in a POMDP depends only on the agent's belief
state</b>. The optimal policy can be described by a mapping \(\pi^* (b)\) from
belief states to actions. 
</p>

<p>
The decision cycle of a POMDP can be broken down into 3 steps:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Given the current belief state \(b\), execute the action \(a = \pi^* (b)\).</li>
<li>Receive percept \(e\).</li>
<li>Update the belief state to \(b'\) and repeat.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If we knew the action and the subsequent percept, then the update to
the belief state would be a deterministic one, following the update
equation. The subsequent percept is not yet known, so the agent will
arrive in one of several possible belief states. The probability of
perceiving \(e\), given that \(a\) is was the action taken from belief
state \(b\), is given by:
</p>

\begin{align}
  P(e | a,b) &= \sum_{s'} P(e | a, s', b) P(s' | a, b) \\
             &= \sum_{s'} P(e|s')P(s'|a, b) \\
             &= \sum_{s'} P(e | s')\sum_{s'}P(s'|s, a)b(s)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  P(b' | a, b) &= \sum_eP(b' | e, a, b) P(e | a, b) \\
               &= \sum_eP(b' | e, a, b)\sum_{s'} P(e|s')\sum_{s'} P(s'
                 | s, a)b(s)
\end{align}

<p>
Where \(P(b' | e, a, b) = 1\) if \(b' = FORWARD(b,a,e)\) and \(0\)
otherwise.

Because POMDPs have continuous state space, new algorithms for
computing or approximating the optimal policies for MDPs do not apply here.

The value iteration algorithm for the MDP computed one utility value
for each state. With infinitely many belief states, we need to be more
creative.
</p>

<p>
Consider conditional plans, and how the expected utility of executing
a fixed conditional plan varies with the initial belief state.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Let the utility of executing a fixed conditional plan \(p\) starting
in physical state \(s\) be \(\alpha_p(s)\). Then the expected utility of
executing \(p\) in belief state \(b\) is \(\sum_s b(s) \alpha_p (s)\) Hence the
expected utility of a fixed conditional plan varies linearly with
\(b\).</li>
<li>At any given belief state \(b\), the optimal policy will choose to
execute the conditional plan with the highest expected utility, and
the expected utility is just the utility of that conditional plan:</li>
</ol>

\begin{equation}
  U(b) = U^{\pi^*}(b) = max_{p} b \cdot \alpha_p
\end{equation}

<p>
If the optimal policy \(\pi^*\) chooses to execute \(p\) starting at \(b\),
then it is reasonable to expect that it might choose to execute \(p\) in
belief states that are close to \(b\).
</p>

<p>
From these 2 observations, we see that the utility function \(U(b)\) on
belief states, being the maximum of a collection of hyperplanes, will
be piecewise linear and convex.
</p>

<p>
Let \(p\) be a depth-d conditional plan whose initial action is \(a\) and
whose depth-d-1 subplan for percept \(e\) is \(p.e\), then
</p>

\begin{equation}
  \alpha_p{s} = R(s) + \gamma \left( \sum_{s'} P(s' | s,a)\sum_e P(e|s')\alpha_{p.e}(s') \right)

The algorithm's complexity is dominated by the number of plans
generated: given \(|A|\) possible actions and \(|E|\) possible
observations, there are \(|A|^{O(|E|^{d-1})}\) distinct depth-d plans,
making the algorithm hopelessly inefficient for larger problems.
