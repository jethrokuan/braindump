<h2 id="org33d1f13"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Meta-cognitive Terms</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>A posteriori</dt><dd>Latin for reasoning or deductions made from known
facts or established knowledge that is not a
prediction or a hypothesis. Can also be used as an
adjective "a posterior knowledge", meaning knowledge
that is dependent on evidence or fact that has
already been established.</dd>
<dt>A priori</dt><dd>Latin for reasoning or deductions made without the need
for known facts or knowledge, that is can be a
hypothesis or prediction, e.g. stangelets are an example
of a priori reasoning. Can also be used as an adjective
“a priori knowledge”, meaning a claim that is true
without having to be backed by empirical evidence, e.g.
all bachelors are unmarried.</dd>
<dt>Abductive Reasoning</dt><dd>One of three types of reasoning, the others
being the more familiar deductive and inductive reasoning. It has
been described as reason that is most likely to lead to a
conclusion because it deals with a subject or knowledge that is
complete as not all the facts can be proven. It has been called
the type of reasoning that requires a leap of faith.</dd>
<dt>Alternative Views</dt><dd>This is another interpretation of the same set
of facts or points of information.</dd>
<dt>Analysis</dt><dd>How information has been dissected to give meaning, e.g.
data analysis. This is the paramount indication of
critical thinking. It is the cognitive process of
“identifying the intended and actual inferential
relationships among statements, questions, concepts…or
other forms of representation intended to express
beliefs, judgments…information, or opinions.”</dd>
<dt>Anecdotal Evidence</dt><dd>Proof which is possibly only true for some
specific instances, not necessarily for all instances. Proof that
may not necessarily be replicated by formal experiment.</dd>
<dt>Appeal</dt><dd>An appeal is a technical term for a rhetorical device used
to make an argument more persuasive. Some forms of
persuasion are listed below, as can be seen some are more
rational than others. When unmasking assumptions and
evaluating arguments, attention should be paid to the type
of appeal being made and whether it is ethical in the
context, e.g. an appeal to emotion to raise money may or
may not be ethical depending on what pressure is being
applied to the emotion of the audience.
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Appeal to Authority</dt><dd>This is an attempt to persuade an audience
that something is correct and should be accepted because it is
endorsed by an authority or an organization with a reputation
for good governance.</dd>
<dt>Appeal to Celebrity/Fashion</dt><dd>This is an attempt to persuade is
made to the audience’s desire to emulate or be like a famous
person or to follow the latest social trend, fashion here
refers to more than clothes, it may also refer to taking
selfies at graduation ceremonies because many people did so
this year.</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt>Appeal to Emotion</dt><dd>This persuasive technique plays on an
audience’s feelings, it uses the Aristotelean notion of pathos.
Its use may be valid e.g. in a court case to ask for clemency for
a pregnant murderer not be executed before her baby is born,
since the baby is innocent of the crime. An appeal to emotion may
be suspect when it is used to make an audience feel they are
lacking if they do not care about a particular issue, e.g. in an
advertisement to allow methadone to be sold as a heroine
substitute in mainstream pharmacists.</dd>
<dt>Appeal to Identity</dt><dd>This persuasive technique works on an
audience’s sense of group versus self-identity, e.g. “Count on
me, Singapore”, “We are Singapore”, “Home” and other National Day
Parade songs work on national identity.</dd>
<dt>Appeal To Logic/Reason</dt><dd>This persuasive technique relies on the use of
logic or a systematic set of propositions in order to convince
the audience of the credibility of the argument. It uses the
Aristotelean notion of logos, and is seen as the strongest form
of persuasion and therefore also argument. This persuasive
technique lends itself to technological and scientific arguments,
but there may be flaws in an argument that entirely relies on
logos, consider for instance, the sorts of argument that would
have had to be debated before the hydrogen bomb was dropped in
Hiroshima.</dd>
<dt>Appeal to Morality</dt><dd>This persuasive technique works on the
audience’s sense of what is right, moral, or ethical. It uses the
Aristotelean notion of ethos, e.g. International pressure on
Ukraine to give more access to the crash site of MH17 is based on
an appeal to morality.</dd>
<dt>Appeal to Popular Belief</dt><dd>This persuades through asking the
audience to consider some common value in humanity, or some
belief that many people value, e.g. family values, a problem may
arise when the definition of the key word, in this case “family”
changes form one section of the population to another, such as
traditional, blended and pink family values. An appeal to
commonality works when there is a strong association between the
audience and the issue at hand, e.g. environmental issues and a
sustainable fishery idea.</dd>
<dt>Appeal to Self-interest</dt><dd>This persuasive technique leverages on
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to convince an audience that a
specific course of action is for their own good, be it personal
security, self-worth, fear of hunger etc. This is most often used
in advertising, e.g. “Because you deserve it”.</dd>
<dt>Argument</dt><dd>Any text graphic, written or spoken that uses reasons
to support the author’s position or point of view.</dd>
<dt>Assertion</dt><dd>Statements that are made without any supporting
evidence of justification.</dd>
<dt>Authorial bias</dt><dd>The inclination or opinion that a writer or a
speaker has for a particular point of view.</dd>
<dt>Authorial voice</dt><dd>This is the opinion of the writer or the speaker,
and not the writer or the speaker quoting from or referring to
anyone else’s view. The authorial voice is important in any
argument as it shows the author’s critical thinking value add.</dd>
<dt>Bandwagon</dt><dd>This term is a metaphor for those who agree or support
a particular idea or campaign because it is fashionable
or popular. These people are said to have “jumped onto
the bandwagon” because they have supported something
without knowing why they have done so. They have been
caught up with the crowd.</dd>
<dt>Bias</dt><dd>Prejudice or propensity towards a particular view.</dd>
<dt>Ceteris Paribus</dt><dd>Latin for “all things being equal”. It is used as
a condition to preface a statement. E.g. “Ceteris paribus the
economy continues to grow at 5% annually, Nagaland will reach its
projected sales target by 2015.”</dd>
<dt>Claim</dt><dd>A declarative (information giving) sentence which may be
true or false. All arguments have claims, when analyzing
arguments, the truth or otherwise of claims have to be
assessed. Claim and declarative statements are also term in
formal logic and C programming, but the definitions in
there are different.</dd>
<dt>Conclusion</dt><dd>When writing or speaking, it is the natural or logical
end point which all the reasons given in an argument
lead to. It can also be a judgment or summative
decision made after reading or listening to someone
else’s argument.</dd>
<dt>Construct an Argument</dt><dd>This means putting together a thesis or
hypothesis, a line of reason with a selection of reasons that
develop or support the thesis or hypothesis and a robust analysis
of the points of information,. All this leads to a warranted
conclusion. There should be care to ensure there are no unfair
instated assumptions, unwarranted inferences or fallacies in the
reasons or the line of reasoning. Care must also be given the
credibility of sources and the accuracy of data. The entire
cognitive process should be expressed cogently, so for instance,
care must be taken over word choice and expression of thought.</dd>
<dt>Counter Argument</dt><dd>This refers to an opposing viewpoint or an
objection raised against a specific argument or claim.</dd>
<dt>Deconstruct an Argument</dt><dd>This means to take apart an argument in
order to assess its component parts and then to evaluate the
argument as a whole.</dd>
<dt>Deductive Reasoning</dt><dd>This is the type of reasoning that leads to a
confirmed or guaranteed conclusion. This is because all the known
facts are given or can be worked out. Mathematics is based
largely on deductive reasoning. It also refers to the sort of
line of reasoning in an argumentative essay where the author
states the thesis at the start of the essay and then sets out
his/her reasons and evidence in support of the thesis.</dd>
<dt>Definition</dt><dd>The meaning of a key word or phrase as used in an
argument, which need not be the same as the dictionary
meaning. But which has to be specified in the
argument.</dd>
<dt>Disposition</dt><dd>Habit or attitude toward a trait of behavior. A
critical thinking disposition is specifically the use
of a self-regulatory systematic means to analyze
information. Such a disposition generally shows
diligence in seeking as much information as possible,
careful attention to detail, respect for the views of
others, consideration in the expressions of one’s own
stance, resilience in working out solutions and
open-mindedness.</dd>
<dt>Double-speak</dt><dd>Word or phrase that is deliberately unclear in
meaning, could be a political or military euphemism,
that is a nice sounding expression for something
that is actually unpleasant, e.g. “friendly fire”
and “collateral damage” – for being shot at by one’s
own side and being killed therefore by accident.</dd>
<dt>Euphemism</dt><dd>A word or phrase that is used to tactfully or politely
refer to something unpleasant or socially taboo, e.g.
“Sanitation engineer” instead of “rubbish man”. It is
not usually meant to be deliberately deceiving unlike a
double-speak expression.</dd>
<dt>Evaluation</dt><dd>Assessing the claims, assertions, opinions or other
representations of an argument or idea. Evaluation
necessitates identifying relevant points for the
argument, credibility of sources, logical consistency,
valid assumptions and appeals.</dd>
<dt>Evidence</dt><dd>Proof that supports a point or conclusion or line of
argument. This may be data, observation, visual
representation e.g. photographs or video, artefact, e.g.
fossils, books, antiques etc.</dd>
<dt>Explanation</dt><dd>This is the process either written or spoken of
justifying or giving reasons for a belief or a
decision. This is the verbal representation of one’s
thought processes.</dd>
<dt>Fact</dt><dd>Proof that is based on something that can be proven by
scientific experiment or replicating a social science
experiment, or something which is true by popular
observation e.g. the sun rises in the east and sets in the
west.</dd>
<dt>Fallacy</dt><dd>An error in reasoning or a flaw or defect in a reason or
a line of reasoning. It can also refer to an argument
being entirely fallacious, e.g. the flat Earth theory was
proven completely fallacious (adjective for fallacy),
once space travel allowed Man to see the planet from
above.</dd>
<dt>False Logic</dt><dd>This is where the propositions do not add up to a
conclusion as stated probably because the context is
not fully explained or some conditions are not met,
e.g. Birds have wings. Airplanes have wings.
Therefore airplanes are birds. False logic is also a
term in mathematics, Boolean logic and computer
science – but the definitions in those other subjects
are different.</dd>
<dt>Generalization</dt><dd>There are valid generalizations and invalid
generalizations. A valid generalization is an
overall statement describing a consistently
observed pattern or trend in data or some other
empirical evidence or social phenomenon. An
invalid generalization is a statement purporting
to describe a pattern or trend in data, other
empirical evidence or social phenomenon that is
based on insufficient sampling, lacking
confirmatory evidence or using anecdotal evidence.
Invalid generalizations contribute to a weak
argument.</dd>
<dt>Habit of Mind</dt><dd>Synonym for critical thinking disposition.</dd>
<dt>Inductive Reasoning</dt><dd>This is the type of reasoning that will give
a conclusion that is probably valid. It also refers to the sort
of line of reasoning in an argumentative essay where the author
starts with a specific question, then builds up a line of
reasoning that leads towards a conclusion.</dd>
<dt>Inference</dt><dd>Critical thinking skill used to identify the
information that is most pertinent to drawing a
reasonable conclusion, hypothesis, theory or educe
consequences arising from data, evidence, principles,
observations or other forms of representation of
information or knowledge.</dd>
<dt>Interpretation</dt><dd>A specific person’s explanation of a phenomenon or
an event. Please see also ‘explanation”.</dd>
<dt>Judicious</dt><dd>Adjective to describe when good or sound judgment or
reasoning is used. E.g. That argument used the data
judiciously to support the inferences and conclusion;
it did not make too big a claim</dd>
<dt>Justification</dt><dd>The explanation for holding a particular view.</dd>
<dt>Line of reasoning</dt><dd>This is the order in which the points selected
to support an argument are arranged. The usual line of reasoning
is that one point should lead into the next point and so build up
a convincing case for the argument.</dd>
<dt>Logical consistency</dt><dd>This means that the points do not contradict
each other within the argument. Also all the reasons support the
conclusion.</dd>
<dt>Man of straw</dt><dd>This is a kind of fallacy in argumentation when an
author deliberately uses something that has been
distorted or represented absurdly and is thus easy
to refute in order to make his/her argument look
stronger, e.g. inventing a fictitious person and
story to illustrate a point, taking an opponents’
words out of context. C.f.
<a href="http://skepdic.com/refuge/ctlessons/lesson9.html">http://skepdic.com/refuge/ctlessons/lesson9.html</a>. It
is sometimes referred to as Aunt Sally.</dd>
<dt>Non sequitur</dt><dd>Latin for “does not follow from”. Used to show that
one point is illogical following from the point
before.</dd>
<dt>Open-minded</dt><dd>This is an attitude or a disposition where one is at
least receptive to another point of view, and to be
willing if necessary to change one’s own view in the
light of convincing new evidence or better reasoning.</dd>
<dt>Position</dt><dd>A point of view supported by reasoning.</dd>
<dt>Predicate</dt><dd>The basis for which an argument is made, a technical term taken from formal logic.</dd>
<dt>Premise</dt><dd>Propositions used that are held to be true and used as a basis for an argument. E.g. Our premise that the rule of law is essential in human society means that law enforcement is integral part of any country.</dd>
<dt>Prima Facie</dt><dd>Latin term meaning “on the surface” or at face value.</dd>
<dt>Propaganda</dt><dd>Information that is transmitted by an organization or government to disseminate a particular view on a topic. This is usually persuasive in nature and is different from public education as it has a more subjective content.</dd>
<dt>Proposition</dt><dd>A statement that is presented as true as part of an argument. This may turn out to be false after evaluation, or less valid than originally presented.</dd>
<dt>Public Education</dt><dd>Information disseminated to inform the general
population. Moe objective content than propaganda. E.g. a public
education poster on wearing condoms to avoid STD is different to
one that says having abortions is murder.</dd>
<dt>Reasoning</dt><dd>This is the process of thinking, also known as cognitive process.</dd>
<dt>Reflection</dt><dd>Thinking back to an action, event or a process to
consider what lessons may be learned in order to make
better progress. A critical thinking reflection is one
in which one looks back on a specific action, event or
process in a systematic way. Critical thinking
practitioners have developed a few templates that
others may use, or one can develop one’s own.</dd>
<dt>Refutation</dt><dd>In an argument, there is a claim which may be followed
by a counter claim. The refutation is the counter
claim to the counter claim that reinstates the
validity of the original claim. E.g. Argument:
Sustained silent reading is a good way of improving
one’s language abilities in a language. Counter
argument: However, does everyone have enough time to
spend on sustained, silent reading every day?
Refutation: Stephen Krashen (1982,) has shown that
reading for as little as 25 minutes a day is
sufficient to build up language skills over time. It’s
a method in argumentation that allows the proposition
to anticipate an objection and to refute it before the
opposition does so. It strengthens the proposition’s
stance.</dd>
<dt>Self-regulation</dt><dd>Synonym for self-discipline, but especially with
regard to applying a critical thinking checklist to all
information that needs to be processed.</dd>
<dt>Stereotype</dt><dd>This is related to a generalization. A stereotype is
an unjustified conclusion or judgment about a specific
group. That is an unwarranted conclusion, e.g. doctors
are rich, Chinese mothers are tiger moms. Stereotypes
give rise to weak arguments.</dd>
<dt>Tautology</dt><dd>Unnecessary repetition, the author makes the same point
but may use different words. Repeating a point does not
reinforce it in a logical way.</dd>
<dt>Unstated Assumption</dt><dd>This is a belief that the author of an
argument assumes his/her audience shares. It is on this unstated
assumption that the author rests his/her case. Unstated
assumptions are valid if they are indeed commonly believed e.g.
cultural assumption among members of the same culture, but they
are not valid if only the author or a select group actually
believes this, e.g. Libraries should have all sorts of books.
Unstated assumptions are often found in propaganda pieces, but
can also be found in most arguments. Most arguments following the
western scientific model will have unstated assumptions about the
conventions of good argument.</dd>
<dt>Value Judgment</dt><dd>The value that someone places on something, this
is essentially subjective. Consider this sentence:
“More works of Shakespeare are sold annually than
Jane Austen novels”. This is a statement of fact
and can be verified with sales figures. However,
“Jane Austen’s books are much easier to read and
are more enjoyable than Shakespeare’s plays.” This
is a value judgment because it is subjective.</dd>
<dt>Weasel Words</dt><dd>Words that make claims sound true but are actually
misleading or false. Weasel words are a sort of
fallacy, e.g. “many experts …” – this makes it look
as if something is endorsed by authorities in the
field, but is so vague that there is no possibility
of checking the credibility of sources. The use of
such words weakens an argument.</dd>
