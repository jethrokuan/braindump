Despite the advances in research in computer vision, the dream of
having a computer interpret an image at the same level of a human is
still far away. Computer vision is inherently a difficult problem, for
many reasons. First, it is an <i>inverse problem</i>, in which we seek to
recover some unknowns given insufficient information to specify the
solution. Hence, we resort to physics-based and probabilistic models
to disambiguate between potential solutions.
</p>

<p>
Forward models that we use in computer vision are usually grounded in
physics and computer graphics. Both these fields model how objects
move and animate, how light reflects off their surfaces, is scattered
by the atmosphere, refracted through camera lenses and finally
projected onto a flat image plane.
</p>

<p>
In computer vision, we want to describe the world that we see in one
or more images and to reconstruct its properties, such as shape,
illumination and color distributions. Some examples of computer vision
being used in real-world applications include Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) , machine inspection, retail, medical imaging, and
automotive safety.
</p>

<p>
In many applications, it is better to think back from the problem at
hand to suitable techniques, typical of an engineering approach. A
heavy emphasis will be placed on algorithms that are robust to noise,
and are reasonably efficient.

The above figure shows a rough layout of the content of computer
vision, and we see that from top to bottom, there are increasing
levels of modeling and abstraction.
