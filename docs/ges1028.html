<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-3">
<p>
Rather than censoring such responses, the Singaporean state responded to the rise in nostalgia by trying to co-opt it for nationalist purposes. In
transforming nostalgia from something that could potentially undermine the policies and rhetoric of development, to a positive part of a broader and
multilayered nation building project, the state is acting in a typically adaptive mode. In mainstreaming nostalgia, the state effectively moved nostalgia away from the 1970s and broadened its meaning.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-4">
<p>
With numerous strategies the Singaporean state attempts to control the meaning of history in Singapore. The past is presented by methods of display, content and absences, as uncontested and unproblematic. The historiography mirrors this. The history that the state constructs and manipulates ratifies the construction of cultural knowledge in Singapore, even when it is authored by. The more active role Singaporeans are playing as creators of historical knowledge has returned Singapore to a more traditional relationship with history. That is, the state is utilizing history as a form of nation building and as a way of negotiating a multiracial society. Instead of history presenting a threat to the fragile balance of a multiracial society, it is now a tool for bringing people together. In the shared experience of life in Singapore as well as the shared experiences of lives—births, marriages, celebrations, etc.—history has become a part of the national story. The state has been effective in widening the focus of nostalgia beyond the dangerous period of the 1970s, but as with other actions of adaptive regimes, as more is given to citizens the greater their potential demands become, and the greater the need for adaptation. In attempting to focus attention towards sites of nostalgia that are less problematic, especially the physical manifestation of buildings, the Singaporean state is still seeking to control the meaning of the past. An emphasis on heritage and the built environment freezes a historical moment and strips it of context. That is, the state is making heritage an object of the present and not the past. Likewise, ‘A Singapore Album’ and blog sites turn nostalgia into something that is contemporary not historical. In so doing the Singaporean state is simultaneously negotiating the production of historical knowledge and seeking to de-politicise history. If, as L. P. Hartley suggested ‘the past is a foreign country,’ 121 then making the past the present makes it less foreign.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-1-1">
<p>
Given that we are social actors born in a specific socio-political and
historical context, we tap upon a range of sources of knowledge when
we attempt to explain social issues or phenomena (e.g. low fertility
rates; academic underperformance; etc.) These can be organised broadly
as lay perspectives; and disciplined perspectives. However, there are
approaches which are regarded more dominant than others. We considered
how and why a particular perspective may emerge as dominant in a
particular context and the key stakeholders interested in sustaining
such dominance.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-1-2">
<p>
To understand Singapore society beyond lay perspectives and the
“commonsense”, the lecture introduced the framework of the
“sociological imagination” (C.W. Mills). This broadly means we are
able to go beyond the individual and connect “private” troubles to
“public” issues (By extension, it is a quality of mind in making the
connection between individual and society; biography and history; and
self and the world.

and the global structures that govern our lives.

Therefore, when we extend our analysis beyond the individual and look
toward more holistic and long-term systemic conditions to explain
specific social phenomena, we move away from a limiting approach which
solely “blames the victim” (Ryan).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-2-1">
<p>
Our lecture stressed that we are not overly preoccupied whether the
past (both pre-colonial and colonial) is historically “accurate” or
otherwise, but rather how particular narratives of the “past” have
been represented as dominant. Therefore, the lecture also considered
who produces history (the “authors”) and its relationship to power,
ideology and the state. In other words, these narratives are produced
to reinforce specific interests of groups who control power and
resources.

<p>
The engagement of “historical consciousness” directs our attention to
focus on the multiplicity of interpretations of “the past” to push the
boundaries of historical knowledge. This means moving beyond history
as a tool for propaganda to appreciate historical complexities and

Our lecture attempted to critically analyse the extent to which active
citizenship engagement on a range of different issues (e.g. the
environment, women’s issues, LGBT and human rights, migrant workers,
etc.) is rendered possible in Singapore. We differentiated between
“civic” and “civil” society, and closely interrogated the role of the
state in establishing legal, social and cultural boundaries pertaining
to citizen participation.

<p>
We also closely discussed the relevance of Lee’s concept of “gestural
politics” in which he refers as essentially “pseudo-politics”
primarily aimed at sustaining the appearance of a liberal democracy
while simultaneously extending the power of the authoritarian state
through legal and extra-legal mechanisms, despite calls to
“inclusiveness” and active citizenship.
</p>

<p>
Globalisation and the internet: The final part of the lecture
emphasised the role of the internet and transnational alliances with
civil society organisations beyond Singapore in an attempt to not only
increase its reach to a wider audience, but more crucially to
strengthen the authority and legitimacy of the different claims local
civil society organisations were making.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-4-1">
<p>
Our lectures made the distinction between race (perceived
physical/genetic attributes considered socially significant to a
collective) and ethnicity (perceived cultural attributes and practices
rendered salient to a group). The lecture further demonstrated how
race and ethnicity are not fixed or immutable categories, but rather
how the meanings of such categories are very much dependent on the
context and temporal dimensions (In the case of Singapore, the lecture
showed the role of colonialism and how this shaped our understanding
of ‘race’ in Singapore). At the same time, the lecture addressed how
these markers were not inherently ‘natural’ especially given the fact
that ‘race’ as a category has been disputed by scientists. Rather,
these markers only carried weight and significance when specific
groups ascribe these physical and/or cultural markers as important.

The lecture emphasised the importance of group membership and how
these are linked to the allocation of rights, privileges, obligations

race and ethnicity are employed as organising principles to govern
social relations and the distribution of resources.

Our lecture then focused on how the state in Singapore makes sense of
difference, how such differences include “race” and the broader
implications of such differences. We attempted to explain how “race”
has been defined by the Singapore state, why “race” has been so
prominent and salient in Singapore, and how these have configured
different dimensions of our social life.

We interrogated how the management of such differences has been
translated into multiculturalist state policies and programmes that
included housing, political representation and education. The lecture
explained the different dimensions of multiculturalism which included
the accordance of “equality” to each community and other principles.
At a more critical level and through different areas of social and
political life in Singapore, we appraised the implications, problems
and contradictions embedded in the ideology of multiculturalism,
particularly in relation to resource allocation, life chances and
experiences of everyday racisms.

The lectures finally appraised how multiculturalism provides the state
the legitimacy to regulate and police race and ethnicity. We further
interrogated how the discourse of “racial harmony” has been
politicised to legitimise and reproduce state power and intervention,
as well as the allocation and distribution of specific rights,
privileges and resources.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-5-1">
<p>
In this lecture, we made the distinction between “sex” (biological and
physical distinctions between male and female) and “gender” (socially
and culturally produced differences between men and women). We also
explained three other important concepts central to our lecture:
sexuality; patriarchy; and heteronormativity. Membership in these
group categories of sex/gender and sexuality are pertinent, given that
these are tied to privileges, rights and resource allocation. These
therefore revisit the primary topic of this section which addresses
social inequalities.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-5-2">
<p>
The second part of the lectures addressed the issue of gender
inequalities and analysed the social, economic, and political
conditions in Singapore which facilitated the ‘naturalisation’ of
dominant gender norms, values, and practices privileging male
experiences. These included our critical appraisal of population and
family policies, and political representation.

<p>
The final part of the lecture critically discussed the inequalities
premised on differences of sexuality and the social implications of
invoking heteronormative discourses pertaining to “conservatism”,
which again legitimises a particular configuration of the patriarchal
and heteronormative familial form as well as acceptable and
permissible gender and sexual behaviour, which at a broader level, is
in line with the state’s economic and productivist interests. The
concept of sexual citizenship was explained to bring to the forefront
again questions of rights and privileges of sexual minorities; as well
as issues pertaining to belonging and emotional attachment to the
nation-state.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-6-1">
<p>
In this lecture, we attempted to explain meritocracy as a system of
stratification and rewards grounded on the basis of merit and
non-discrimination (ethnicity, gender, sexuality, family, etc.). We
discussed the key characteristics of meritocracy and how such a system
which has been institutionalised and normalised in Singapore has
shaped different dimensions in Singapore society. These include the
fields of education and politics. We further appraised the challenges
and contradictions in the ideology of meritocracy and unpacked the
impetus of the ruling elite to sustain such an ideology, especially in
relation to the justification of the given distribution of resources,
rights and rewards. These also obscure how life chances and success
are intimately shaped and connected to cultural capital, social
connections, and other considerations. The lectures show further how
the potentially egalitarian characteristics of meritocracy may clash
with its emphasis on talent allocation, competition and reward,
thereby transforming this into an ideology of elitism and inequality.

<p>
The lectures addressed the implications of widening income disparities
and class inequalities. These were connected to provisions have been
organised along racial self-help groups and away from state welfare,
and the consequences and problems of such a system that has been
institutionalised in Singapore. These have been rationalised to steer
attention away from an overdependence on the state for help and
obscuring inequalities which have been produced through widening
income gap and other state policies.

We also demonstrated how the ideology of meritocracy takes attention
away from structural conditions and the role of the state in
allocating resources, placing the onus of accountability to the
individual instead. At the same time, the repetition of meritocracy
denounces the presence of discrimination, arguing that success and
failure are contingent on the basis of merit.

The second part of the lectures elaborated on the concept of “living
religions” and outlined the religious landscape in Singapore. The
focus of living religions stresses on the level of religious practice
and everyday religiosity. We employed the case study of Hinduism to
further show how living religions may not necessarily fit within
strict frames of religious behaviour. We used the concept of
“mixing-and-matching” (process of selecting and enacting different
styles of religiosity preferred by a practitioner without these
traditions merging and becoming a unitary whole).

during occasions where religious beliefs and practice contravene
national interests and security. In this section we focused on the
role of the state, state intervention and religion in Singapore; and
the implications of possible competing interests between religious
adherents/practitioners and the state.

<p>
The lecture first considered the broader global and local conditions
that organised health care provision and financing in Singapore. These
included the dominant patterns in population affecting Singapore –
large ageing population, low fertility rates, high old-age dependency
ratio, increased morbidity and life expectancy, rise of chronic
illnesses, and wider income disparities and inequalities, contributing
to escalating health care costs.

<p>
We subsequently examined the different principles structuring the
health care system and policies in Singapore (both in terms of health
care financing and coverage) and critically appraised the shortcomings
of health care in Singapore. These can be categorised as ‘spectacular’
and ‘systemic’ failures, based on the prescribed reading.

<p>
At the same time, we identified several groups which may be more
vulnerable than others such as HIV patients – as well as the problems
these groups potentially faced. The provision of health care
infrastructure to its citizens is also intimately tied to broader
state interests and legitimacy to rule the nation.

The lecture primarily outlined the relationship between the state,

interests of the state pertaining to the arts (instrumental, pragmatic
and political gains), as compared to the interests of arts
practitioners.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-9-2">
<p>
We introduced and applied the concept of “cultural hegemony” and its
different dimensions to demonstrate how the ruling elites have been
able to naturalise a set of dominant ideas, beliefs and practices as
“universal” and “normal”. These ideologies can be potentially conveyed
through popular culture and the arts.

<p>
Different forms of popular culture (films, TV, music, plays, etc.) can
be readily appropriated by the state to normalise state ideologies
such as multiculturalism and meritocracy, but at the same time such
forms can also be deployed by producers of popular culture and the
arts to critically respond to issues and problems in Singapore
society.

<p>
In our lecture, we screened the film “Ilo Ilo” which allows us to
recalibrate our understanding of migrant workers in our everyday
lives. At the same time, the film also afforded us glimpses to
extrapolate relevant concepts we have employed in our module
pertaining to the meanings of difference and its concomitant
privileges, rights and access to resources; as well as concepts such
as prejudice, discrimination, power and inequality embedded through
race/ethnicity, class and gender as organising principles.

In the next and final lecture (Week 13), it will briefly contextualise
and elaborate the position of migrant workers as reflected in the
film, how categories of migrants are established (foreign “worker” vs.
foreign “talent”) and the implications of these distinctions in a
“global city” like Singapore.
