policies provide the ultimate standard against which moral decisions
must be evaluated

<h3 id="org6d0b518"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Duty-based (Deontology)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Kant points out that, in some instances, performing our duties may
result in our being unhappy and may not necessarily lead to
consequences that are considered desirable.
</p>

<p>
Kant bases deontology on two premises:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Our nature as rational creatures
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rationality is what separates us from other kinds of creatures. If
our primary nature were to merely seek happiness or pleasure, we
would be indistinguishable from other creatures.</li>
<li>Rational nature reveals certain duties or obligations to each
other as "rational beings"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Human beings are ends-in-themselves
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A genuinely moral system would never permit some humans to be
treated as means to the ends of others</li>
<li>We have a duty to treat fellow humans as ends; each individual
has the same moral worth</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Categorical Imperative</b>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Act always on that maxim or principle (or rule) that can be
universally binding, without exception, for all human beings.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This forms a system of universality and impartiality. The objective
rule to be followed—that is, the litmus test for determining when an
action will have moral worth—is whether the act complies with the
categorical imperative, and whether it is universal and impartial.
</p>

<p>
<b>Act Deontology</b>:
</p>

<p>
Ross argues that when two or more moral duties
clash, we have to look at individual situations in order to determine
which duty will override another.
</p>

<p>
Ross believes that we have certain prima facie (or self-evident)
duties, which, all things being equal, we must follow. He provides a
list of prima facie duties such as honesty, benevolence, justice, and
so forth.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Reflect on the competing prima facie duties.</li>
<li>Weigh the evidence at hand to determine which course of action
would be required in a particular circumstance.</li>

<h3 id="org5d16231"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Contract-based</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
In his classic work <i>Leviathan</i>, Hobbes describes an original
"premoral" state that he calls the "state of nature." It is premoral
because there are no moral (or legal) rules yet in existence. In this
state, each individual is free to act in ways that satisfy his or her
own natural desires. According to Hobbes, our natural (or physical)
constitution is such that in the state of nature we act in ways that
will enable us to satisfy our desires (or appetites) and to avoid what
Hobbes calls our "aversions."
</p>

<p>
Hobbes believes that we are willing to surrender some of our
"absolute" freedoms to a sovereign. In return, we receive many
benefits, including a system of rules and laws that are designed and
enforced to protect individuals from being harmed by other members of
the system.
</p>

<p>
We see that it is in our individual self-interest to develop a moral
system with rules.

<h4 id="orgc6814c3"><span class="section-number-4">3.3.1</span> Criticisms</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-3-1">
<p>
Some critics, such as Pojman (2006), point out that contract-based
theories provide the foundation for only a minimalist morality. They
are minimalist in the sense that we are obligated to behave morally
only where an explicit or formal contract exists. So if I have no
express contract with you, or if a country such as the United States
has no explicit contract with a developing nation, there is no moral
obligation for me to help you or for the United States to come to the
aid of that developing nation.

<p>
Because virtue ethics focuses primarily on character development and
moral education, it does not need to rely on a system of formal
rules.
</p>

<p>
Character-based ethical systems would most likely flourish in cultures
where the emphasis placed on community life is stronger than that
accorded to the role of individuals themselves.

Broadly speaking, a computer/IT professional is anyone employed in the
computing and IT fields—from software and hardware engineers, to
specialists such as support person- nel, network administrators, and
computer repair technicians.
</p>

<p>
As IT professionals we have significant opportunities to:
</p>

<h4 id="org135aa9b"><span class="section-number-4">5.2.1</span> Naturally private vs normatively private</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-2-1">
<p>
In a naturally private situation, individuals are protected from
access and interference from others by natural means, for example,
physical boundaries such as those one enjoys while hiking alone in the
woods. In this case, privacy can be lost but not violated, because
there are no norms—conventional, legal, or ethical—according to which
one has a right, or even an expectation, to be protected. In a
normatively private situation, on the other hand, individuals are
protected by conventional norms (e.g., formal laws and informal
policies) because they involve certain kinds of zones or contexts that
we have determined to need normative protection.

<div id="outline-container-orgb7a52a6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb7a52a6"><span class="section-number-3">5.3</span> Contextual Integrity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
Nissenbaum’s privacy framework requires that the processes used in
gathering and disseminating information (a) are "appropriate to a
particular context" and (b) comply with norms that govern the flow of
personal information in a given context. She refers to these two types
of informational norms as follows:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Norms of appropriateness.</li>
<li>Norms of distribution.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Whereas norms of appropriateness determine whether a given type of
personal information is either appropriate or inappropriate to divulge
within a particular context, norms of distribution restrict or limit
the flow of information within and across contexts. When either norm
has been "breached," a violation of privacy occurs; conversely, the
contextual integrity of the flow of personal information is maintained
when both kinds of norms are "respected."

<h3 id="org841bc0a"><span class="section-number-3">5.4</span> The Value of Privacy</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">
<p>
Fried suggests that unlike most instrumental values that are simply
one means among others for achieving a desired end, privacy is also
essential, that is, necessary to achieve some important human ends,
such as trust and friendship. We tend to associate intrinsic values
with necessary conditions and instrumental values with contingent, or
nonnecessary conditions; so while privacy is instrumental in that it
is a means to certain human ends, Fried argues that it is also a
necessary condition for achieving those ends.
</p>

<p>
Moor believes that privacy is an articulation, or "expression" of the
"core value" security, which in turn is essential across cultures, for
human flourishing.
</p>

<p>
Based on the insights of DeCew and others, one might infer that
privacy is a value that simply benefits individuals. However, some
authors have pointed out the social value that privacy also provides,
noting that privacy is essential for democracy.

Big data promises to use this data to make the world more transparent,

Big data seeks to identify, but it also threatens identity. This is
the Identity Paradox. We instinctively desire sovereignty over our
personal identity. Whereas the important right to privacy harkens from
the right to be left alone, the right to identity originates from
the right to free choice about who we are.
</p>

<p>
If we lack the power to individually say who “I am,” if filters and
nudges and personalized recommendations undermine our intellectual
choices, we will have become identified but lose our identities as we
have defined and cherished them in the past.

default, until they are left reeling from scandal after shock of
disclosure. The result is an uneasy, uncertain state of affairs that
is not healthy for anyone and leaves individual rights eroded and our

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-1">
<p>
Copyright is a form of protection provided to the authors of “original
works of authorship” including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic,
and certain other intellectual works, both published and unpublished.
The 1976 Copyright Act generally gives the owner of copyright the
exclusive right to reproduce the copyrighted work, to prepare
derivative works, to distribute copies or phonorecords of the
copyrighted work, to perform the copyrighted work publicly, or to
display the copyrighted work publicly.
</p>

<p>
The copyright protects the form of expression rather than the subject
matter of the writing. For example, a description of a machine could
be copyrighted, but this would only prevent others from copying the
description; it would not prevent others from writing a description of
their own or from making and using the machine. Copyrights are

<p>
A trademark is a word, name, symbol or device which is used in trade
with goods to indicate the source of the goods and to distinguish them
from the goods of others. A servicemark is the same as a trademark
except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service
rather than a product. The terms “trademark” and “mark” are commonly
used to refer to both trademarks and servicemarks.
</p>

<p>
Trademark rights may be used to prevent others from using a
confusingly similar mark, but not to prevent others from making the
same goods or from selling the same goods or services under a clearly
different mark. Trademarks which are used in interstate or foreign
commerce may be registered with the Patent and Trademark Office.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-3">
<p>
A patent for an invention is the grant of a property right to the
inventor, issued by the Patent and Trademark Office. The term of a new
patent is 20 years from the date on which the application for the
patent was filed in the United States or, in special cases, from the
date an earlier related application was filed, subject to the payment
of maintenance fees. US patent grants are effective only within the
US, US territories, and US possessions.
</p>

<p>
The right conferred by the patent grant is, in the language of the
statute and of the grant itself, “the right to exclude others from
making, using, offering for sale, or selling” the invention in the
United States or “importing” the invention into the United States.
What is granted is not the right to make, use, offer for sale, sell or
import, but the right to exclude others from making, using, offering
for sale, selling or importing the invention.
