1. LDA, DTM - don't work as well as deep learning model

LDA: list of important words for n topics
DTM: make LDA time variant

Problems: common wworks like "computer"... 

HITS algo, similar to PageRank

2 concepts, authors, keywords -> important authors say important
keywords

modified textrank

<NN>*<NN|NNS>

1. Author -> keyphrases
2. Keyphrase needs to be clustered LDA, Embedding
3. What is a trend? (coarser grain than keyphrase), hierachical
   agglomerate clustering

* Connecting to SoC VPN
use openfortivpn.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo openfortivpn webvpn.comp.nus.edu.sg:443 -u e0036913 -p pass --trusted-cert cert

* Setting up GPU cluster
1. Install Anaconda
2. Setup conda environment with required packages
3. conda env update
4. source activate fastai

* Current Methodology
1. Use TextRank algorithm
** TextRank
Prior to TextRank, use NLTK to extract noun phrases via Regex. Each
noun phrase is split further.
** RNN
Basic RNN is employed to use the first k sequential years to predict
the (k+1)th years score. The model takes the top 20 phrases for each
year, and the top 20 based on predictions from the RNN. It is expected
that the predicted phrases closely match the actual top 20 phrases of
the year.

A linear regression model is used as the baseline comparison.
** Definition of Trend
Considerations:

1. Research areas should have a strong foundation, but not be the
   most-discussed issue at the same time
2. Research areas should be gradually studied

\begin{equation*}
trend = a \times (x\textsubscript{k+1} - max(x\textsubscript{1}, ... , x\textsubscript{k})) + (1 - a) \times max(x\textsubscript{1}, ... , x\textsubscript{k})
\end{equation*}

* Keyphrase Extraction
Keyphrase extraction (KE) is the task of automatically extracting
descriptive phrases or concepts that represent the main topics of a
document.

In supervised approaches, a candidate phrase is encoded with a set of
features, such as /tf-idf/. One problem is that many of these manual
features are determined based on statistical information from
documents outside the target domain. Hence, it is essential to
automatically discover such features without relying on feature
engineering.
** SurfKE
*** Graph Construction
Build an undirected word graph, with words as vertices. There is an
edge between two words if the words co-occur within =w= contiguous
word tokens. The weight of the edge is computed based on the
co-occurence within a window of w successive tokens in the
document.
*** Learning Feature Representations
Learn a mapping function $f : V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{|V| \times d},
d \le |V|$ where d is a parameter specifying the number of dimensions
for the embeddings. The network feature learning model requires a
corpus and a vocabulary in order to learn a mapping of nodes to a
low-dimensional space of features. A biased sampled random walk
strategy is employed.
* Topical Hierarchy
[[file:~/Dropbox/NUS/UROP/CATHY_-_Construction_of_Topical_Hierarch.pdf][CATHY]]

CATHY - co-occurrence network clustering, recursively apply
CATHY to discover sub-topics
