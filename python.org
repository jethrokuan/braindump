* Python Nifty Tricks
1. =for= loop has =else= clause, that runs when the for loop successfully
   completes without =break.=
2. =str.maketrans= creates a translation table that makes string
   substitution quick.
3. ~s.index(x) == s.rindex(x)~ to check if character is only one in the string

** Data Structures

*** Heap
Heaps are provided by the =heapq= library in python.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import heapq

  a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  # Heapq defaults to min heap
  heapq.heapify(a) # makes a into a min heap object
  heapq.heappop(a)

  heapq._heapify_max(a) # Makes a into max heap
  heapq._heappop_max(a)

#+END_SRC

*** Priority Queue
[[https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html][Reference]]

The ~queue~ module provides FIFO, LIFO and Priority Queues. Among them,
~queue.PriorityQueue~ is perhaps the most commonly used in interview
questions.

 ~class queue.PriorityQueue(maxsize=0)~

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
  import queue
  pq = queue.PriorityQueue()

  pq.put((10, 'ten'))
  pq.put((1, 'one'))
  pq.put((5, 'five'))

  x = []
  while not pq.empty():
      print(pq.get())
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: (1, 'one')
: (5, 'five')
: (10, 'ten')
