* Span
The "span" of $\hat{v}$ and $\hat{w}$ is the set of all their linear
combinations:

\begin{equation}
 a \hat{v} + b \hat{w}
\end{equation}

* Basis
The basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors
that span the full space.

* Matrices as Linear Transformations

A transformation is linear if it fulfills two properties:

1. All lines remain lines (they don't get curved)
2. The origin is fixed.

Under a linear transformation, grid lines remain parallel and evenly
spaced. This property allows us to compute the transformed vector,
only by recording how the basis vectors are transformed.

* Matrix Multiplication as Composition
Often, we want to describe the effects of multiple linear
transformations composed together, for example, a rotation, followed
by a shear. The composition of linear transformations is also a linear
transformation, and can be described with a single matrix (see above).

Hence, we can think about matrix multiplication as computing where the
final basis vectors land.
