* Preface

This is an internal guide explaining how I take notes in Org-mode and Org-roam.
I write this in hopes that this will provide insight into my note-taking
process. Please understand that note-taking is a personal practice and what
works best for me may not work for you.

Let me first introduce myself. Professionally I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at
Abnormal Security. I try to keep up with recent developments in tech, and
occasionally read technical papers relevant to my field or area of work. As a
(serious) hobby I play the guitar, and I'm also trying to integrate portions of
my music study into my Zettelkasten. I've been using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] to take
notes for several years, and the note-taking process I am now documenting has
evolved organically over the years, and is always subject to minute
optimizations. [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]] is a byproduct of this process, which I've made
available for public consumption.

I hope that while reading this document you keep close at heart the guiding
principles and purposes of note-taking, in the context of your own work and
life. If you have specific questions/doubts along the way, you can create a
GitHub issue [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam-guide/issues][here]].

* The Note-taking Mindset

I take notes because I want these notes to to *serve me later on* in my life.
This system is meant to be an extension of my physical brain: an evolving
cache of information that I will at some point want to recall.

This has several implications. This means that:

1. I want the notes in my system to contain only what's relevant to me. This
   changes over time: I need a way to delete/add notes freely without
   disruption.
2. All fleeting notes I take must be regularly processed: turned into permanent
   notes, or discarded entirely when no longer needed
3. Permanent notes should resurface when relevant to the current topic at hand

The first point has several implications. Notes must be well-factored and
self-contained, such that deleting them will not result in a sudden gap in
context.

These are some behaviour I observed in the wild that don't quite gel with me:

- taking too much notes :: especially prevelant is the copying of text wholesale
  from sources. Notes should be a distillation of what you've read: rewriting
  ideas and concepts in your own words helps reinforce understanding.
- taking notes about everything :: To maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio, we
  need to be picky about what is added into your Zettelkasten.
- having an overly-complex note-taking workflow :: Automation becomes
  detrimental to note-taking. The quality of notes is highly correlated with the
  amount of deliberation for each character you put into your slipbox.

* The Slipbox Setup

I keep my workspace simple. I maintain one mega slip-box: all my notes are kept
within ~org-roam-directory~. True to Luhmann's original implementation, within
the mega slip-box I keep two primary slipboxes.

The first slipbox is the *reference slipbox*. It contains zettels that contain
information from various sources I consume (books, articles, papers etc.). Each
reference zettel points back to the original source.

The second slipbox, for the lack of a better name, is the *main slipbox*. It
contains my own ideas and concepts, extracted from the material I read. They
point back to reference slipbox zettels.

I maintain an additional *articles "slipbox"*. This is a folder containing
articles that are a culmination of my ideas in the main slipbox, as well as
references from the reference slipbox. This is an example of one such article.

Finally I have an inbox file, where unprocessed ideas are captured.

Altogether, I have a directory structure that looks like this:

#+caption: My org-roam-directory structure. Each slipbox is contained in their own folder. My journals and written articles are also in their own folder.
#+BEGIN_SRC text
.
├── articles
├── main
├── reference
├── inbox.org
└── biblio.bib
#+END_SRC

This directory structure is reflected in my three capture templates, one for a
main zettel, one for a reference zettel, and one for an article.

#+caption: My Org-roam capture templates. There is one for each zettel type.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :exports code
(setq org-roam-capture-templates
      '(("m" "main" plain
         "%?"
         :if-new (file+head "main/${slug}.org"
                            "#+title: ${title}\n")
         :immediate-finish t
         :unnarrowed t)
        ("r" "reference" plain "%?"
         :if-new
         (file+head "reference/${title}.org" "#+title: ${title}\n")
         :immediate-finish t
         :unnarrowed t)
        ("a" "article" plain "%?"
         :if-new
         (file+head "articles/${title}.org" "#+title: ${title}\n#+filetags: :article:\n")
         :immediate-finish t
         :unnarrowed t)))
#+END_SRC

I use two separate slipboxes to maintain a strict distinction between an
original thought and an idea from an external source. This allows for proper
attribution, and also allows us to return to the source to dig further if a
particular line of thought is extra intriguing.

It'd of course also be useful to differentiate the different types of zettels at
completion time. This used to be a feature in Org-roam v1, which I'd removed.
Thankfully, the code is architectured such that you could define your own
properties on nodes. In this case, I want to define the "type" of note based on
its file path. This is simple enough:

#+caption: Creating the property "type" on my nodes.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :exports code
(cl-defmethod org-roam-node-type ((node org-roam-node))
  "Return the TYPE of NODE."
  (condition-case nil
      (file-name-nondirectory
       (directory-file-name
        (file-name-directory
         (file-relative-name (org-roam-node-file node) org-roam-directory))))
    (error "")))
#+end_src

Now, for ~type~ to show up in the completion interface, I just add it to my display template:

#+caption: Modifying the display template to show the node "type"
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :exports code
(setq org-roam-node-display-template
      (concat "${type:15} ${title:*} " (propertize "${tags:10}" 'face 'org-tag)))
#+end_src

And now it shows up!

** Zettel Structure

#+begin_src org
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       575c27d4-7f15-4167-8fa2-d1c5c83b0cad
:END:
,#+title: Example Zettel
,#+filetags: :some:tags:

...
#+end_src

I keep things simple by keeping my zettels file-based. While Org-mode provides
the facilities for using headline hierarchy, I find that it provides little
value to my note-taking, and can have an adverse effect on my thinking. It is
possible to give ideas and thoughts structure without relying on the Org-mode
hierarchy, through index/organizational zettels.

* Capturing Thoughts

I capture any thoughts I have that I would want to process into my slipbox using
plain ~org-capture~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :exports code
(setq org-capture-templates
      ;; other capture templates
      ("s" "Slipbox" entry  (file "braindump/org/inbox.org")
       "* %?\n"))

(defun jethro/org-capture-slipbox ()
  (interactive)
  (org-capture nil "s"))
#+end_src

You could use ~org-roam-capture~ for this, but I see no point for the
added complexity. I bind ~jethro/org-capture-slipbox~ to a key of my choice.
Honestly, I find that I make much less use of this than a typical academic
would: this is because it is not my business to produce original ideas or
thoughts. My zettelkasten is primarily for me to consume content and reinforce
understanding by forming links to material I have already ingested.

* Creating Zettels

** Reference Zettels

I create reference zettels when I'm consuming material I've come across. Each
reference zettel has a corresponding ~ROAM_REFS~ key, which corresponds to the
canonical source. They come in two main forms:

- [cite:key] :: For academic items, I use Org-mode 9.5 citations. These include
  papers and books, which happen to be my primary source of material.
- https://google.com :: For websites, I use their canonical URL.

*** Citation Management

I manage my citations with [[https://www.zotero.org/][Zotero]]. I use the [[https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/][Better BibTeX]] plugin to auto-export
all my files into a single ~biblio.bib~ file, located at the root of my
~org-roam-directory~. My bibliography setup is not complex: in fact, it is [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom
Emacs']] default [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/tree/master/modules/tools/biblio][biblio module]].

#+CAPTION: Zotero, a bibliographic management system
[[file:media/how_i_take_notes_in_org_roam/zotero.png]]

What's crucial for me here the ability to capture any source quickly into
Zotero, using the Zotero Web Connectors. For example, if I come across a paper
on Arxiv that I want to process, I can use the Zotero Firefox connector to
quickly add the citation into Zotero. It will also fetch a copy of the paper for
me. I use these offline copies to make annotations on these pdfs while reading,
and the pdfs get synced across my different computers by placing my Zotero
library within Dropbox. The citations themselves are synced using Zotero's free
online service.

*** Reference Citation Zettels

For each source, I create /one and exactly one/ zettel. Sometimes this can get
unwieldy: one can consider splitting by chapters if really necessary. To create
a reference citation zettel, I use a custom function I wrote that picks out a
citation key, and creates a note for it:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :exports code
(defun jethro/org-roam-node-from-cite (keys-entries)
    (interactive (list (citar-select-ref :multiple nil :rebuild-cache t)))
    (let ((title (citar--format-entry-no-widths (cdr keys-entries)
                                                "${author editor} :: ${title}")))
      (org-roam-capture- :templates
                         '(("r" "reference" plain "%?" :if-new
                            (file+head "reference/${citekey}.org"
                                       ":PROPERTIES:
:ROAM_REFS: [cite:@${citekey}]
:END:
,#+title: ${title}\n")
                            :immediate-finish t
                            :unnarrowed t))
                         :info (list :citekey (car keys-entries))
                         :node (org-roam-node-create :title title)
                         :props '(:finalize find-file))))
#+end_src

#+begin_export html
<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ewfAaY6Pj8A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
#+end_export

The full flow is therefore as such:

1. Use Zotero Web Connector to add source into Zotero
   1. Zotero automatically fetches offline copy of source material, if possible.
      If not, I will manually fetch it and add it to the Zotero library.
2. BetterBibTex automatically updates ~biblio.bib~, making it available to Emacs.
3. I call ~jethro/org-roam-node-from-cite~, select the correct reference, and a
   new reference zettel is created.
4. I read the source material using a local program, making multiple passes and
   annotate along the way. I then jot notes, and find existing zettels in my
   zettelkasten to link to.

It's possible to write a function in similar vein for website-based reference
zettels, but I didn't see a need to do so. For these, I key them in manually.

** Every Zettel is a Draft until Declared Otherwise

All zettels begin as unrefined notes. To keep my Zettelkasten high-quality, it
is important for me to constantly revisit and refine these draft notes. Once I
am satisfied with the draft zettels, I can then mark them as complete. This is
similar to Andy Matuschak's concept of [[https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes][evergreen notes]].

I mark all of my new zettels with the tag ~draft~, by doing the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun jethro/tag-new-node-as-draft ()
  (org-roam-tag-add '("draft")))
(add-hook 'org-roam-capture-new-node-hook #'jethro/tag-new-node-as-draft)
#+END_SRC

Note: I do not yet have a system for revisiting zettels.

* Guiding Principles
** Not Everything Needs To Be Done In Emacs

One common complaint about Org-roam is mobile support: it is non-trivial to get
Emacs up and running on mobile, and even then adding notes on the fly is not so
easy.

There is also a strong desire for Org-roam to develop a solid publishing
workflow. There are projects that are work-in-progress, but they all take
significant amount of setup. Zettelkastens are not meant for public consumption.
Notes should be written for yourself and yourself only. Published materials
should be a thoughtful composition of multiple zettels, with a healthy injection
of your own summaries.

My initial motivation for publishing my notes was twofold. First, then I'd
occasionally point friends to things I mention, but more often than not the
zettels I had written were gibberish to them, since they were written for me.
Second, I thought it'd be good to be able to review zettels on the go. I find
that this was generally suboptimal use of my time.

As an alternative, I am exploring using spaced repetition to deepen my
understanding of the zettels I have written.

* Addendum
** Choosing Your Citation Package

Org-mode currently has 3 different citation keys: Org-ref v2, Org-ref v3,
Org-mode 9.5 native citation keys.

For Org-mode citations, I recommend the wonderful [[https://github.com/bdarcus/citar][citar]] package. For Org-ref
style citations, you will be using [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]].

My recommendation is to use one or the other, and not mix both, although you
certainly could.

** TODO How to Write Good Zettels

This is a really difficult skill, one that I'm still trying to get adept at as
well. It's obviously a lot more nuanced and complex than this, but here's some
guiding principles that I found useful.

*** Zettels should be Atomic

A large part of content understanding is being able to break things down into
simple concepts and linking them together. If your zettels are getting extremely
long, it's a sign that you haven't yet fully broken down the content in it. A
good signal is naming your zettels. If you can come up with a short sentence to
summarize the content of your zettel, you should be good.

Zettel titles should be also /specific/. You shouldn't run into name clashes on
your zettels.

*** Zettels should be Encapsulated

A zettel should be readable on its own, without surrounding context.

As someone from a tech background, this can be unintuitive, but *it's okay
to repeat yourself*! If you have two notes that are related, ~X~ and ~Y~, it's
okay to write about how ~Y~ is related to ~X~ in ~X~, and how ~X~ is related to
~Y~ in ~Y~. Imagine trying to follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
here: you'll end up "refactoring" the ~X~ and ~Y~ notes by linking them to a
note ~Z~ that talks about how ~X~ and ~Y~ are related. Then you can't read
either ~X~ or ~Y~ without going to read ~Z~!

** What About Everything Else?

Org-roam ships other features, but here's why I don't use them.

**Org-roam-protocol**

Org-roam-protocol used to be my go-to method for taking notes on content from
all sorts of sources, from websites to books. I mean, how convenient to be able
to pop up the note for the current source you're reading!

Here I think too much convenience was a bad thing. Over time I learnt to slow
down and not be over-eager in taking notes. Now I consume material in separate
passes, kind of like a loose version of the [[http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf][three-pass approach]]. I skim the
material, assessing whether it is worth reading in detail (and taking notes
about) in the first place. In a few other passes, I take brief notes or
highlight various parts that catch my eye. Finally, I handcraft my notes.
Comparatively, I take fewer but more relevant notes.

**Org-roam-dailies**

I used to keep my scattered thoughts within daily pages within Org-roam, but I
find that these often add more noise than signal into what should be a pristine
garden. I don't really need the date information anyway: why should when I noted
something down affect whether something is relevant to me now?

So now I've simplified and keep my unprocessed thoughts in a single Org file.
Journal entries, which are admittedly few and far between, are kept separately.

** What about Task Management?

It's tempting to combine task management (e.g. [[https://gettingthingsdone.com/][Getting Things Done (GTD)]]) with
your Zettelkasten. This is the curse of Emacs and Org-mode: it's just way too
powerful and multi-functional, and it's also the Emacs way to use the same tool
for everything.

I ultimately decided to keep the two systems separate, despite using Org-mode
for both of them. The primary reason is that these systems are just too
different. They operate on different modes of thinking: note-taking and
knowledge creation will always require large amounts of brain work. On the other
hand, GTD makes task management a simple, effortless process. Having separate
systems allows my brain to operate in these different modes as required.

It's also tempting to leave todos within the zettels, and use ~org-agenda~ to
show what's left to be processed. I prefered centralizing todos and tasks
elsewhere, keeping my Zettelkasten clean (see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory][broken windows theory]]).
