- Exactly one replica is designated the master. This task manages the
  others and reports status for the job as a whole. The training
  service runs until your job succeeds or encounters an unrecoverable
  error. In the distributed case, it is the status of the master
  replica that signals the overall job status.
- If you are running a single-process job, the sole replica is the
  master for the job.
- One or more replicas may be designated as workers. These replicas do
  their portion of the work as you designate in your job
  configuration.
- One or more replicas may be designated as parameter servers. These
  replicas coordinate shared model state between the workers.
