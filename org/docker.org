*** Containers are Cheap

- Docker provides lightweight virtualization with almost zero
  overhead.
- Start and stop containers within seconds.
** Containers are Portable
Containers contain all the required software dependencies to run your
application.

Once a container is built, you can be sure it runs "the same way" on any
host operating system with the same Linux kernel.

* What is Docker?
Docker is a toolchain for managing containers.

* What You'll Do Today
You'll be packaging a simple application with Docker.

If time permits, we'll cover additional things, such as passing
environment variables.

** Pulling images
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker pull alpine
#+END_SRC
*** Alpine?
=alpine= is an image for a tiny Linux distribution, used by Docker for
most of its official images.

A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of
a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code,
runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings.

=alpine= is pulled from the Docker Registry, where hundreds of
thousands of images are hosted.
** Starting a container
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker run alpine
#+END_SRC

What is happening here?
** Running a command
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker run alpine echo "Hello from alpine!"
#+END_SRC
** Docker Status
List all docker images:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker images
#+END_SRC

List all running docker containers:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker ps
#+END_SRC

List all docker containers (including stopped containers):
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker ps -a
#+END_SRC
** Entering a Container Interactively
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker run -it alpine sh
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  uname -r                        # 4.9.41-moby
  hostname                        # container_id
  whoami                          # root
  id                              # uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(bin)...
#+END_SRC
* Inside =alpine=
 Docker images consist of multiple layers:

 #+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%

** Layers for the ubuntu image
 Observe the output for the following:
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker pull ubuntu:15.04
   docker history ubuntu
 #+END_SRC
** Declare layers with a =Dockerfile=
#+BEGIN_SRC docker-file

* Docker Networking
Docker creates three networks by default. We're mostly concerned with
=bridge=.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  $ docker network ls

  NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
  7fca4eb8c647        bridge              bridge
  9f904ee27bf5        none                null
  cf03ee007fb4        host                host
#+END_SRC
** How =bridge= works 
Unless specified otherwise, the docker container will connect to this
default =bridge= network. This provides a means of Docker containers
to access the outside world. This is achieved through rules on the
kernel's =iptable=.

By default, none of the ports are published and the outside world has
no access to the docker containers.
** Running a Simple Webserver
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  nc -ll -p 8080 -e /bin/echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n$(date)\n"
#+END_SRC
** Allowing Ingress
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker run -p 5001:8080 alpine \
          nc -ll -p 8080 -e /bin/echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n$(date)\n"
 #+END_SRC

 As a daemon:
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker run -p 5001:8080 -d alpine \
          nc -ll -p 8080 -e /bin/echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n$(date)\n"
 #+END_SRC
* Exercise: package a Node.js Server with Docker
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  curl -i http://localhost:5001/
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK

  Hello world!!
#+END_SRC
** Server code
#+BEGIN_SRC text
  https://git.io/vdXLC
#+END_SRC
** General Instructions
   1. Install the Node.js runtime (use Ubuntu)
   2. Copy the files into the container
   3. Get the node package manager =npm=
   4. Run =npm install=
   5. Run =npm start= to start server
* But... I want to change my files!
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker run -d my/webserver
  # Create file locally
  docker exec -it container_name sh
  ls #WAT
#+END_SRC
** Mounting Volumes
There are three types of mounts:

1. *Volumes* are managed by docker. Volumes also support the use of
   volume drivers, which allow you to store your data on remote hosts
   or cloud providers, among other possibilities.
2. *Bind Mounts* may be stored anywhere on the host filesystem.
3. *tmpfs mounts* are stored in the host system's memory only.
** Mounting the =/src= directory
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker run -p 5000:8080 -v ~/path/to/directory:/usr/src/app/src my/webserver
#+END_SRC
* Beyond Docker
Docker is the building block for many devops solutions.

1. Container Orchestration: Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry etc.
2. Monitoring: cAdvisor, InfluxDB etc.
3. Reverse Proxies and Load Balancers: fabio etc.

Docker makes microservices manageable and scalable.
