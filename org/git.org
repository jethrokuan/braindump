** Content of .git folder
Git stores snapshots (exact content of the files) at the point of a commit.
#+begin_src sh
ls .git
#+end_src

#+results:
| COMMIT_EDITMSG |
| config        |
| description   |
| FETCH_HEAD     |
| HEAD          |
| hooks         |
| index         |
| info          |
| logs          |
| objects       |
| ORIG_HEAD      |
| packed-refs   |
| refs          |

The content is stored in the objects sub-directory. There are 4 kinds
of objects:

- blob :: used for storing the contents of a single file
- tree :: contains references to other blobs or subtrees
- commit :: contains reference to another tree object and some other
            information (author, committer etc.)
- tag :: Another reference to a commit object
