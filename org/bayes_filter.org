- tags :: [[file:gaussian_filter.org][Gaussian Filter]]

* Notation
- $\eta$ :: normalizing constant, to make probability distribution sum
  to 1.
- $\text{bel}(t) = p(x_t | z_{1:t}, u_{1:t})$ :: posterior
  probabilities over state variables conditioned on available data
- $\overline{\text{bel}}(t) = p(x_t | z_{1:t-1}, u_{1:t})$ :: belief
  taken /before/ incorporating the measurement $z_t$

$\overline{\text{bel}}(t)$ often called the prediction in Bayes
filtering. Computing $\text{bel}(t)$ from
$\overline{\text{bel}}(t)$ is called /correction/ or the /measurement
update/.

* Algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Bayes Filtering}
  \label{bayes_filter}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Procedure{BayesFilter}{$\text{bel}(x_{t-1}), u_t, z_t$}
    \ForAll{$x_t$}
    \State $\overline{\text{bel}}(t) = \int p(x_t | u_t, x_{t-1})
    \text{bel}(x_{t-1}) dx$
    \State $\text{bel}(t) = \eta p(z_t | x_t)\overline{\text{bel}}(t) (x_t)$
    \EndFor
    \State \Return $bel(x_t)$
    \EndProcedure
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

* Details
Mathematical derivation makes the [[file:markovian_assumption.org][Markovian Assumption]].

Exact techniques for belief calculation are reserved for specialized
cases. In most scenarios, these beliefs have to be approximated, and
these approximations have important ramifications on the complexity of
the algorithm.

Approximations requires trading off:

- Computational Efficiency :: Linear Gaussian approximations can
  calculate beliefs in time polynomial to the state space. Other
  approximations may be exponential. Particle filter techniques have
  the any-time characteristic, allowing them to trade off accuracy
  with computational efficiency.
- Accuracy :: Linear Gaussian approximations are limited to unimodal
  distributions, whereas histogram approximations are multi-modal, but
  have limited accuracy. Particle representations can approximate
  a wide array of distributions, but large number of particles may be
  required for high accuracy.
- Ease of implementation :: Difficulty in implementation typically
  arises from the form of the transition and measurement probabilities
  (see [[file:robotics_probabilistic_generative_laws.org][Robotics Probabilistic Generative Laws]]). Particle
  representations lend themselves to simple implementations for
  complex non-linear systems.
