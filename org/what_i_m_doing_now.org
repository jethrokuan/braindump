#+title: 🌿 What I'm Doing Now

This is a regularly updated log of what I'm currently looking into.

- [[file:high_performance_natural_language_processing.org][High Performance Natural Language Processing]]. The research conducted here is
  part of my day job.
- Working on [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]], as usual. Developmental progress on it has sort of
  stalled. Now that I'm getting back into research, the flaws and things I want
  are starting to show, and I want to sit on my workflow a bit more before
  upgrading Org-roam to fit it better.
- Pruning this digital garden. There are a lot of unnecessary notes. It always
  feels wasteful to delete notes, but I think it will eventually be for the
  best.
- Thinking about the tension between plain text and the multi-media experience
  we have ([[id:a3268b6d-203b-4be6-a4b6-de92585eba3d][Plain Text Is Not Enough]])
