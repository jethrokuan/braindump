#+TITLE: Optimal Control and Planning

How can we make decisions if we know the dynamics of the environment?

* Stochastic optimization

Stochastic optimization for open-loop planning:

We wish to choose $a_1, \dots a_T = \mathrm{argmax}_{a_1, \dots a_T}
J(a_1, \dots, a_T)$ for some objective $J$.

** Guess and Check

An extremely simple method, that's parallelizable:

1. pick $A_1, \dots A_N$ from some distribution
2. choose $A_i$ based on $\mathrm{argmax} J(A_i)$.

** Cross-entropy Method (CEM)

1. pick $A_1, \dots A_N$ from some initial distribution $p(A)$
2. Evaluate $J(A_1), \dots J(A_N)$
3. pick the elites $A_{i1}, \dots A_{im}$ with the highest value
4. fit distribution $P(A) to the elites

With continuous inputs, a multi-variate normal distribution is a
common choice for $p(A)$. In the discrete Case, Monte-Carlo tree
search ([[file:mcts.org][§mcts]]) is typically used.

* Using Derivatives

- Differentiable Dynamic Programming (DDP)
- LQR
