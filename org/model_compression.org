*  And the Bit Goes Down: Revisiting the Quantization of Neural Networks cite:stock19_and_bit_goes_down

This method minimizes the loss reconstruction error for in-domain
inputs, and does not require any labelled data.

This method exploits the high correlation in the convolutions in
ResNet-like architectures by the use of product quantization (PQ). The
approach here focuses on reconstructing the activations, and not the
weights. This results in better in-domain reconstruction, and does not
require any supervision.

Vector Quantization (VQ) and Product Quantization (PQ) decompose the
high-dimensional space into a cartesian product of subspaces that are
quantized separately. These are typically studied under the context of
nearest neighbour search.
