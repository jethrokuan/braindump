* Why study conversation?
- Tt seems that everyone can conduct conversation
- There are basic patterns and techniques
  - People do not adopt a totally new or different system for
    communicating in any given situation
  - Conversational skill is adopted to other forms of interactive talk

#+begin_quote
"What I call social facts are the ways of acting, thinking, and
feeling external to the individual, and endowed with a power of
coercion, by reason of which they control him"

- Emile Durkheim

*** Garfinkel's 'breaching' experiment
- Spend from 15 minutes to an hour in their homes imagining that you
  are boarders and act out this assumption. You should conduct
  yourself in circumspect and polite fashion. Avoid getting personal,
  to use formal address, to speak only when spoken to.
- Clarify everything which may not be immediately understandable for
  the non-family members

We obey certain social rules, and make underlying social assumptions
in all our interactions. This brings about social order.
*** What is a social situation?
#+begin_quote
I would define a social situation as an environment of mutual
monitoring possibilities... wherein an individual will find themselves
accessible to the naked senses of all others who present -- and
similarly, find those others accessible to him.

- Erving Goffman

** Linguistics
- Traditional linguistics see the language as an internal cognitive
  representation of individuals.
- Grammatical categories reflect cultural patterns of thinking and
  acting -- Boas, Sapir
- Encourage inquiry to speech event, speech situation, speech
  community -- Gumperz, Hymes

how conversational practices fit together in highly intricate ways.
** Basic assumptions

2. Order is produced, situated, and occasioned
3. Order is repeatable and recurrent
** Characteristics of Conversation

    predetermined or planned
