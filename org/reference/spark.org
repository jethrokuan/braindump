#+title: Spark

* What is Apache Spark?
A cluster computing platform designed to be fast and general-purpose.
It extends the MapReduce to support more types of computations, and
covers a wide range of workloads that previously required separate
distributed systems.

Spark is a computational engine that is responsible for scheduling,
distributing and monitoring applications consisting of many
computational tasks across many worker machines.
* The Spark Stack
- Spark Core :: contains basic functionality, including memory
                management, scheduling, fault recovery and interacting
                with storage systems. It contains the API for =RDD=s,
                which represent a collection of items distributed
                across many nodes that can be manipulated in parallel.
- Spark SQL :: allows querying of data via SQL, and supports many
               sources of data.
- Spark Streaming :: Provides support for processing live streams of data.
- MLLib ::  Contains basic ML functionality, such as classification
           and regression.
- GraphX :: Library for manipulating graphs, and contains common graph
            algorithms like PageRank.
- Cluster Managers :: Library that enables auto-scaling via cluster
     managers such as Hadoop YARN, Apache Mesos, and its own
     Standalone Scheduler.

For Data Scientists, Spark's builtin libraries help them visualize
results of queries in the least amount of time. For Data Processing,
Spark allows Software Engineers to build distributed applications,
while hiding the complexity of distributed systems programming and
fault tolerance.

While Spark supports all files stored in the Hahoop distributed
filesystem (HDFS), it does not require Hadoop.

* Getting Started
Enter the shell with =spark-shell=, or =pyspark=. 

#+begin_src python
  lines = sc.textFile("README.md")
  lines.count()
  lines.first()
#+end_src

* Core Spark Concepts
Every Spark application consists of a /driver program/ that launches
various parallel operations on a cluster. The driver program contains
the application's =main= function and defines distributed datasets on
the cluster.

Driver programs access Spark thorugh a =SparkContext= object, which
represents a connection to a computing cluster.

Once we have a SparkContext, we use it to create RDDs. Driver programs
typically manage a number of nodes called /executors/. A lot of
Spark's API revolves around passing functions to its operators to run
them on the cluster.

#+begin_src python
  lines = sc.textFile("README.md")
  lines.filter(lambda line: "Machine" in line)
#+end_src

* Running a Python script on Spark
=bin/spark-submit= includes the Spark dependencies, setting up the
environment for Spark's Python API to function. To run a python
script, simply run =spark-submit script.py=.

After linking an application to Spark, we need to create a
SparkContext.

#+begin_src python
  from pyspark import SparkConf, SparkContext

  conf = SparkConf().setMaster("local").setAppName("My app")
  sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)
#+end_src

* Programming with RDDs
An RDD is a distributed collection of elements. All work is expressed
as either creating new RDDs, transforming existing RDDs or calling
operations on RDDs to compute a result.

RDDs are created by: (1) loading an external dataset, or (2) creating
a collection of objects in the driver program.

Spark's RDDs are by default recomputed every time an action is run. To
reuse an RDD in multiple actions,  we can use =rdd.persist=. In
practice, =persist()= is often used to load a subset of data into
memory to be queried repeatedly.

#+begin_src python
  lines = sc.parallelize(["pandas", "i like pandas"])
#+end_src

** RDD Operations
RDDs support /transformations/ and /actions/. Transformations are
operations on RDDs that return a new RDD (e.g. =map= and =filter=).
Actions are operations that return a result to the driver program, or
write it to storage,and kick off a computation.

#+begin_src python
  errorsRDD = inputRDD.filter(lambda x: "error" in x)
  warningsRDD = inputRDD.filter(lambda x: "warning" in x)
  badLinesRDD = errorsRDD.union(warningsRDD)
#+end_src

Spark keeps track of RDD dependencies from various transformations in
a /lineage graph/, that way if a RDD is lost, it can be recreated from
its dependencies.

Transformations on RDDs are /lazily evaluated/, so Spark will not
execute until an action is seen.

When passing a function that is a member of an object, or contains
references to fields in an object, Spark sends the entire object to
worker nodes, which can be larger than the information you need.  This
can also cause the program to fail, if the class contains objects that
Python cannot pickle.

Basic Transformations:
- =map()=, =flatMap()=
- pseudo-set operations: =distinct()=, =union()=, =intersection()=,
  =subtract()=
- =cartesian()=

Actions:
- =reduce(lambda x, y: f(x,y))=
- =fold(zero)(fn)=  is reduce, but takes an additional zeroth-value parameter
- ==take(n)==, ==top(n)==, =takeOrdered(n)(ordering)=,
  =takeSample(withReplacement, num, [seed])=
- =aggregate(zero)(seqOp, combOp)= is similar reduce, but used to return
  a different type
- =foreach(fn)=

** Persistence
Different level of persistence helps with making Spark jobs faster. If
a node with persisted data goes down, Spark will recreate the RDD from
the /lineage graph./

* Working with Key/Value Pairs
Spark provides special operations on RDDs with KV pairs, called pair
RDDs.

For Python and Scala, the RDD needs to be composed of tuples:

#+begin_src python
  pairs = lines.map(lambda x: (x.split(" ")[0], x))
#+end_src

#+begin_src scala
  val pairs = lines.map(x => (x.split(" ")(0), x))
#+end_src

Java does not have a built-in tuple type, so it uses the
=scala.Tuple2= class.

| collectAsMap() | Collect the result as a map to provide easy lookup  |
| lookup(key)    | Return all values associated with the provided key. |

** Data Partitioning
Spark programs can choose to control their RDDs' partition to reduce
communication. Sparks's partitioning is available on all RDDs of
key/value pairs, and cause the system to group elements based on a
function of each key.

We use =partitionBy()= to return a new RDD that partitions the Spark
frame efficiently. Below are the operations that benefit from
partitioning:

- cogroup
- groupWith
- join
- leftOuterJoin
- rightOuterJoin
- groupByKey
- reduceByKey
- combineByKey
- lookup

Implementing a custom partitioner in Python is relatively simple:

#+begin_src python
  import urlparse

  def hash_domain(url):
      return hash(urlparse.urlparse(url).netloc)

  rdd.partitionBy(20, hash_domain)
#+end_src

The hash function will be compared by identity to that of other RDDs,
so a global function object needs to be passed, rather than creating a
new lambda.

* Loading and Saving Your Data
  For data stored in a local or distributed filesystem such as NFS,
  HDFS, or S3, Spark can access a variety of file formats including
  text, JSON, SequenceFiles and protocol buffers. Spark also provides
  structured data sources through SparkSQL, and allows connections to
  databases like Cassandra, HBase, Elasticsearch and JDBC databases.

SequenceFiles are a popular Hadoop format composed of flat files with
key/value pairs. They have sync markers that allow Spark to seek to a
point in the file and then resynchronize with the record boundaries,
allowing Spark to efficiently read them in parallel from multiple nodes.

#+begin_src python
  data = sc.sequenceFile(inFile, # input file
                         "org.apache.hadoop.io.Text", # key Class
                         "org.apache.hadoop.io.IntWritable", # value Class
                         10 # min partitions
  ) 
#+end_src

#+begin_src python
  data = sc.parallelize((("Panda", 3), ("Kay", 6)))
  data.saveAsSequenceFile(outputFile)
#+end_src


** SparkSQL
SparkSQL can load any table supported by Apache Hive.

#+begin_src python
  from pyspark.sql import HiveContext

  hiveCtx = HiveContext(sc)
  rows = hiveCtx.sql("SELECT name, age FROM users")
  firstRow = rows.first()

  print firstRow.name
#+end_src

It even supports loading JSON files, if the JSON data has a consistent
schema cross records.

#+begin_src python
  # {"user": {"name": "Holden", "location": "SF"}, "text": "Nice"}

  tweets = hiveCtx.jsonFile("tweets.json")
  tweets.registerTempTable("tweets")
  results = hiveCtx.sql("SELECT user.name, text FROM tweets")
#+end_src

* Advanced Spark Programming
  In this section, we look at some techniques that were not previously
  covered, in particular /shared variables/: /accumulators/ to aggregate
  information and /broadcast variables/ to efficiently distribute large
  values.

#+begin_src json
  {
    "address": "address here",
    "band": "40m",
    "callsign": "KK6JLK",
    "city": "SUNNYVALE",
    "contactlat": "37.384733",
    "contactlong": "-122.032164",
    "county": "Santa Clara",
    "dxcc": "291",
    "fullname": "MATTHEW McPherrin",
    "id": 57779,
    "mode": "FM",
    "mylat": "37.751952821",
    "mylong": "-122.4208688735"
  }
#+end_src

** Accumulators
When we normally pass functions to Spark, they can use variables
defined outside of them in the Spark program, but updates to these
variables are not progagated to the driver. Spark's shared variables
relax this restriction for two common typess of communication
patterns: aggregation of results and broadcasts.

#+begin_src python
  file = sc.textFile(inputFile)

  blankLines = sc.accumulator(0)

  def extractCallSigns(line):
      global blankLines # Make the global variable accessible
      if (line == ""):
          blankLines += 1
      return line.split(" ")

  callSigns = file.flatMap(extractCallSigns)
#+end_src

Tasks on worker nodes cannot access the accumulator's value. This
allows accumulators to be implemented efficiently without having to
communicate every update.

For accumulators used in actions, Spark applies each task's update to
each accumulator only once. Thus, for a reliable absolute value
counter, the accumulator should be in an action such as =foreach()=. For
accumulators used in RDD tarnsformations instead of actions, this
guarantee does not exist.
