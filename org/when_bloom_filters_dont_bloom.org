Modern CPUs are really good at sequential memory access, whet it's
possible to predict memory fetch patterns. Random memory access is
very costly.

Modern computers require cache-optimized algorithms. When working with
large datasets, not fitting L3 cache, prefer optimizing for reduced
number loads, over optimizing the amount of memory used.

[[file:20200227141922_bloom_filter.org][Bloom Filters]] are great, as long as they fit into the L3 cache. They
are optimized for memory usage, not memory access. A nice alternative
is [[file:cuckoo_filters.org][Cuckoo Filters]].
