Gpipe is a scalable pipeline parallelism library published by Google
Brain, which allows for efficient training of large, memory-consuming
models cite:huang18_gpipe. Pipeline parallelism allows for
[[file:fast_nn_training.org][§fast_nn_training]]. 

In Gpipe, neural networks with sequential layers are partitioned
across accelerators. The pipeline parallelism divides each input
mini-batch into smaller micro-batches, enabling different accelerators
to work on different micro-batches simultaneously. This is especially
useful in [[file:large_batch_training.org][§large_batch_training]].
