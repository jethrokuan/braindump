Most algorithms rely on segmentation of RGB-D data. 3D object recognition is
done by matching 3D data to their known CAD models. [[file:interactive_closest_point.org][Interactive Closest Point]]
can be used to calculate the alignment and best fitting of a cloud of points
with respect to a reference CAD model.

A fast voting scheme similar to the Generalized Hough Transform can be used improving the performance of [[file:interactive_closest_point.org][ICP]].

Deep Learning approaches used RGB-D images as input, and are able to predict
grasp success and generalize to novel objects.
