#+title: RSS 2020 Workshops: Visuotactile Sensors for Robust Manipulation - From Perception to Control

* Meta
- Venue :: RSS
- Year :: 2020

* Soft Manipulation

Soft grippers enhance the robustness of gripping, particularly for complex object geometries

- Compliance is a double-edged sword
- We may need to sense what actually happened from "our" side of the compliance
- We cannot assume post-grasp pose of objects
- We may need to maintain a specific grasp pose or force
- We may need to control through contact

** Dense Geometry Tactile Sensors (DGT)

Benefits compared to RGB-D sensors:

1. Agnostic to lighting conditions
2. Agnostic to self-occlusion during manipulation
3. Agnostic to hard-to-see objects

Drawbacks:
1. Modelling difficulties

** Modelling the Soft Membrane Dynamics

- Use quasi-static approximation to model deformation in membrane
- Knowing the deformation, it is possible to infer which part of the model causes the deformation (inverse model)
