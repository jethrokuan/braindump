Why are we curious about some things but not others? What are the core
cognitive systems that people use to guide their learning about the
world?

* 5 Key things in ML that we should know about humans
** Humans continuously form beliefs
  Upon seeing a bowl, we update our belief about what a bowl is. This
  also influences what we wish to sample next. Infants look away when
  events are predictable, but also when they are surprising!

*When present data to learning algorithms, we should show data that is
at ideal region on the "surprising" spectrum.*

** Certainty diminishes interest

We are not curious about things that we already know. If we think we
know an answer, when presented with the objective truth, we are still
unlikely to change our beliefs.

** Certainty is driven by feedback

When feedback isn't available, our estimates about our certainty may
not be accurate. When feedback is readily available, we can sometimes
be certain, when we should not be.

** Less feedback may encourage overconfidence

** Humans form beliefs quickly
